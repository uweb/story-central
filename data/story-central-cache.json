To understand how, Assistant Professor Jacqueline Padilla-Gamino is going beyond where most divers can go.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","content":"<strong>(College of the Environment, June 2019)<\/strong>\r\n\r\nJust beyond where conventional scuba divers can go is an area of the ocean that still is largely unexplored. In waters this deep \u2014 about 100 to at least 500 feet below the surface \u2014 little to no light breaks through.\r\n\r\nResearchers must rely on submersible watercraft or sophisticated diving equipment to be able to study ocean life at these depths, known as the <a href=\"https:\/\/oceanservice.noaa.gov\/facts\/mesophotic.html\">mesophotic zone<\/a>. These deep areas span the world\u2019s oceans and are home to extensive coral reef communities, though little is known about them because it is so hard to get there.\r\n\r\ncollaborative research team from the University of Washington, College of Charleston, University of California Berkeley, University of Hawaii and other institutions has explored the largest known coral reef in the mesophotic zone, located in the Hawaiian Archipelago, through a series of submersible dives. There, they documented life along the coral reef, finding a surprising amount of coral living in areas where light levels are less than 1% of the light available at the surface.\r\n\r\nTheir <a href=\"https:\/\/aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/full\/10.1002\/lno.11164\">findings<\/a> were published this spring in the journal Limnology and Oceanography.\r\n\r\n\"Because mesophotic corals live close to the limits of what is possible, understanding their physiology will give us clues of the extraordinary strategies corals use to adapt to low-light environments,\u201d said lead author <a href=\"https:\/\/fish.uw.edu\/faculty\/jacqueline-padilla-gamino\/\">Jacqueline Padilla-Gami\u00f1o<\/a>, an assistant professor in the UW School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences.\r\n\r\nKnowing how these deep coral reefs function is important because they appear to be hotspots for biodiversity, and home to many species found only in those locations, Padilla-Gami\u00f1o explained. Additionally, close to half of all corals in the ocean have died in the past 30 years, mostly due to warm water temperatures that stress their bodies, causing them to bleach and eventually die. This has been documented mostly in shallower reefs where more research has occurred. Scientists say that more information about deeper reefs in the mesophotic zone is critical for preserving that habitat.\r\n\r\n\u201cMesophotic reefs in Hawaii are stunning in their sheer size and abundance,\u201d said co-author <a href=\"http:\/\/biology.cofc.edu\/about-the-department\/faculty-staff-listing\/spalding-heather.php\">Heather Spalding<\/a> at College of Charleston. \u201cAlthough mesophotic environments are not easily seen, they are still potentially impacted by underwater development, such as cabling and anchoring, and need to be protected for future generations. We are on the tip of the iceberg in terms of understanding what makes these astounding reefs tick.\u201d\r\n\r\nPadilla-Gami\u00f1o was on board during two of the team\u2019s eight submersible dives off the coast of Maui that took place from 2010 to 2011. Each dive was a harrowing adventure: Researchers spent up to eight hours in cramped quarters in the submersible that was tossed from the back of a larger boat, then disconnected once the submersible reached the water.\r\n\r\nOnce in the mesophotic zone, they collected specimens using a robot arm, and captured video footage and photos of life that has rarely been seen by humans.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really unbelievable place,\u201d Padilla-Gami\u00f1o said. \u201cWhat is surprising is that, in theory, these corals should not be there because there\u2019s so little light. Now we\u2019re finally understanding how they function to be able to live there.\u201d\r\n\r\nBy collecting coral samples and analyzing their physiology, the researchers found that different corals in the mesophotic zone use different strategies to deal with low amounts of light. For example, some species of corals change the amount of pigments at deeper depths, while other species change the type and size of symbionts, which are microscopic seaweeds living inside the tissue of corals, Padilla-Gami\u00f1o explained. These changes allow corals to acquire and maximize the light available to perform photosynthesis and obtain energy.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the corals at deeper depths are likely eating other organisms like zooplankton to increase their energy intake and survive under very low light levels. They probably do this by filter feeding, Padilla-Gami\u00f1o said, but more research is needed to know for sure.\r\n\r\nThe researchers hope to collect more live coral samples from the mesophotic zone to be able to study in the lab how the symbionts, and the corals they live inside, function.\r\n\r\n\"The more we can study this, the more information we can have about how life works. This is a remarkable system with enormous potential for discovery,\u201d Padilla-Gami\u00f1o said. \u201cOur studies provide the foundation to explore physiological \ufb02exibility, identify novel mechanisms to acquire light and challenge current paradigms on the limitations of photosynthetic organisms like corals living in deeper water.\u201d\r\n\r\nOther co-authors are Celia Smith at University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa; Melissa Roth at UC Berkeley; Lisa Rodrigues at Villanova University; Christina Bradley at Salisbury University; and Robert Bidigare and Ruth Gates at Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology.\r\n\r\nThe study was funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Science Foundation."},{"title":"The surprising history of musical theater","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/the-surprising-history-of-musical-theater\/","tags":["arts-sciences","school-of-drama","theater"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"At the UW School of Drama, Seattle theater legend David Armstrong teaches the history of Broadway musicals \u2014 and of the immigrant, LGBTQ, Jewish and African American creatives who shaped this American institution.","content":"When American leaders discuss how immigration has shaped the United States, they never mention musical theater. Perhaps they should.\n\n\u201cThere would be no Broadway musicals if America\u2019s doors had not been opened wide to immigrants,\u201d says David Armstrong, affiliate instructor in the <a href=\"https:\/\/drama.washington.edu\/\">UW School of Drama<\/a>, who views the rise of the Broadway musical as largely an immigration story. Armstrong shares that history in a new course, The Broadway Musical: How Immigrants, Queers, Jews, and African Americans Created America\u2019s Signature Art Form.\n\nArmstrong\u2019s lifelong passion for musical theater began when he was just seven years old. His mother, intending to take him and his sister to see the film\u00a0<em>Dumbo<\/em>, mistakenly took them to the film musical\u00a0<em>Gypsy\u00a0<\/em>instead, about a stripper. He was mesmerized.\n\n\u201cFortunately my mother was not uptight, so she didn\u2019t make us leave the theater,\u201d laughs Armstrong, whose career in theater has included 18 years as executive producer and artistic director of Seattle\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.5thavenue.org\/\">5<sup>th<\/sup> Avenue Theater<\/a>. \u201cI\u2019m interested in all kinds of theater, but I think musical theater is the most impactful because it affects us on all levels\u00a0\u2014\u00a0intellectual, physical, and emotional.\u201d\n\nArmstrong explains that musical theater got its start following a huge wave of Irish immigration in the late 1800s. Of particular importance was Irish immigrant George M. Cohan, a writer, director, producer, and performer who launched musical theater as a distinct genre in the early 1900s. \u201cThis was the era of \u2018Irish need not apply,\u2019\u201d says Armstrong. \u201cDiscrimination against Irish immigrants was rampant. When George M. Cohan stood on stage and sang \u2018I\u2019m a Yankee Doodle Dandy,\u2019 that was a huge political statement.\u201d\n\nAround the same time, Jewish immigrants arrived from Eastern Europe and African Americans moved to New York from the South, further developing the art form. Like the Irish, these groups faced discrimination and had few opportunities for advancement. But the middle- and upper-class audiences that attended theater performances looked down on performing as a profession, leaving that field wide open for the lower classes. For those who had talent, musical theater was a way out of poverty.\n\nThat was the case for Irving Berlin, who came to the U.S. from Russia at age five and grew up dancing for pennies on the Lower East Side. With little education and no formal musical training, Berlin became America\u2019s songwriter laureate, writing thousands of songs including God Bless America, White Christmas, and Easter Parade, as well as 17 complete scores for Broadway musicals and revues, including <em>Annie Get Your Gun<\/em>.\n\nRenowned songwriter Cole Porter and other members of the queer community were also among those working at the highest levels of musical theater from the start. \u201cFor the queer community, the early 20<sup>th<\/sup>\u00a0century was a very open period,\u201d says Armstrong. \u201cPeople were not quite openly gay, but almost. They were valued and largely accepted in that world.\u201d\n\nArmstrong features all of these musical theater pioneers in his course, weaving in the huge influence of African American writers and performers, and the less visible but significant contribution of women working as songwriters, lighting designers, and choreographers. He then traces the bumpy road of musical theater, which has included periods of great popularity followed by decline and evolution.\n\nThe genre\u2019s first decline came during the Great Depression, when only the sophisticated elite could afford tickets. The number of productions dropped by half, and shows became more urbane and sophisticated to attract an audience. Hollywood began producing film musicals during this period, broadening the audience. Then in 1943, Roger and Hammerstein\u2019s <em>Oklahoma<\/em> came to Broadway. It integrated its story, song, and dance more cohesively than any show before, ushering a Golden Age for musicals that would last nearly 30 years.\n\n\u201cAll of the classics come from that period,\u201d says Armstrong, who explains that before <em>Oklahoma<\/em>, operettas, revues, and musical comedies were entertaining\u00a0but very loosely constructed. <em>Oklahoma<\/em>\u2019s new form and phenomenal success led to other shows built around story and characters. \u201cIt was an evolution, but it felt more like a transformation,\u201d says Armstrong. \u201cIt became a much more impactful art form.\u201d\n\nAnother shakeup came with the Vietnam War, when a growing cynicism led to shows like\u00a0<em>Cabaret<\/em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>Sweeney Todd<\/em>\u00a0that featured darker themes and antiheroes. Broadway composers initially chafed at the popularity of rock and roll music, but eventually incorporated rock and other pop styles, a trend that has continued. Today\u2019s widely successful\u00a0<em>Hamilton,\u00a0<\/em>featuring hip hop music, has ushered in another Renaissance and introduced a new generation to Broadway.\n\nMost students are familiar with\u00a0<em>Hamilton<\/em>, but homework assignments introduce them to shows that came before. Armstrong assigns film versions of selected musicals, often pairing shows from different eras to explore thematic similarities. (Both\u00a0<em>Gypsy\u00a0<\/em>and\u00a0<em>Hairspray<\/em>, for example, feature transgressive women who refuse to follow the rules.) He also presents clips in class, and has students attend a UW production and two musicals at the 5<sup>th<\/sup>\u00a0Avenue Theater during the quarter \u2014 the latter at a fraction of the usual price thanks to his connections.\n\nThrough this immersion, students discover common themes in musicals. The most ubiquitous is race, from\u00a0<em>Showboat<\/em>\u00a0in the\u00a01920s\u00a0to\u00a0<em>West Side Story<\/em>\u00a0in the\u00a01950s\u00a0to\u00a0<em>Hamilton\u00a0<\/em>today. \u201cOver the 120-year history of musical theater, about 37 musicals have dealt with race as principal subject matter,\u201d says Armstrong, who spends a full class session exploring the theme.\n\nToward the end of the quarter, students will dream up their own ideas for a new musical, which they will pitch to a panel of industry professionals, hoping to demonstrate how their story would benefit from this unique form of storytelling. The students are unlikely to come up with the next\u00a0<em>Hamilton,\u00a0<\/em>but Armstrong hopes the class project \u2014 and the course \u2014 will forever change the way they look at musicals.\n\n\u201cAfter this class, these students will never see musicals the same way again,\u201d says Armstrong. \u201cThey will have an appreciation for the form, and see it as an important cultural touchstone. It is our great American art form, and I\u2019m thrilled to share it.\u201d"},{"title":"Costumes with a story to tell","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/costumes-with-a-story-to-tell\/","tags":["arts-sciences","school-of-drama"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"School of Drama\u00a0graduate student in costume design, Chant\u00e9 Hamann, tells the stories of vintage costumes.","content":"<strong>(School of Drama, March 2019)<\/strong>\n\n<span class=\"dropcap\">C<\/span>hant\u00e9\u00a0Hamann is obsessed with costumes. A <a href=\"https:\/\/drama.washington.edu\/\">School of Drama <\/a>(SoD) graduate student in costume design, Hamann is particularly intrigued by vintage costumes that reference the past. So when four large boxes of costumes donated in the 1960s were discovered in SoD storage, she was eager to learn what was inside.\n\nWhat she found was the best present she could imagine.\n\nThe boxes held a trove of costumes worn by famed actor Sarah Bernhardt and others more than a century ago, including hats, handmade silk shoes, beaded and sequined sashes, undergarments, wigs, and nearly 20 gowns. \u00a0\u201cMany of them are ball gowns with a capital G,\u201d says Hamann. \u201cThey have big sleeves, trains, everything.\u201d\n\nImmediately realizing the significance of the collection, Hamann invited fellow graduate students and SoD design faculty to help with the initial unpacking of the boxes. Skip Mercier, senior lecturer for set and costume design, recalls a memorable evening of discovery.\u00a0\u201cThat night there was a lot of\u00a0oooh-ing\u00a0and\u00a0ahhh-ing,\u201d\u00a0Mercier\u00a0says. \u201cAs we uncovered each layer, it was like an\u00a0archaeological\u00a0dig. It almost felt like we were going through civilizations of things.\u201d The conversation quickly turned to next steps, including how to research and preserve the collection.\n\nSome information was already available, including the source of the donation\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a costume house in Portland. When the School of Drama received the boxes in the mid-1960s, information tags were added to many of the pieces, but most offered just a basic description. \u201cIt seems the collection had been sorted through at the time and then neatly tucked away,\u201d says Hamann.\n\nHamann was immediately drawn to a box that had \u201cCostumes owned by Sarah Bernhardt,\u201d jotted on its side. Bernhardt, a French stage actress who performed internationally in the late 1800s, was known for the outrageous volume of clothing she owned and for acting in male lead roles \u2014 which explains why some of the suede breeches, vests, and other male clothing in the box have nips and tucks to better fit a female body. Bernhardt was also memorable for her a larger-than-life personality. \u201cLater in life she had one of her legs amputated to the hip,\u201d says Hamann, \u201cand like the proper little diva she was, she opted for being carried around in her ornately decorated chair by two men.\u201d\n\nThe boxes also revealed costumes worn by Sarah\u00a0Truax, an American stage actress who toured and performed on Broadway. Through her research,\u00a0Hamann\u00a0uncovered a <a href=\"https:\/\/digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu\/digital\/collection\/sayre\/id\/12123\">1904 photo of\u00a0Truax\u00a0performing in Seattle<\/a>, in which she appears to be wearing a costume from the collection. \u201cBoth of these\u00a0Sarahs\u00a0were known to have performed in Seattle,\u201d says\u00a0Hamann. \u201cSarah Bernhardt performed at the\u00a0Cordray\u2019s\u00a0in 1891 and Sarah Truax performed at the Grand Opera House in 1904.\u201d\n\nTruax\u00a0later settled down in Seattle and \u2014 in an odd coincidence \u2014 was buried in a Lake Forest Park cemetery across the street from\u00a0Hamann\u2019s\u00a0apartment.\u00a0 \u201cI haven\u2019t gone to find her yet, but I feel like I need to,\u201d\u00a0Hamann\u00a0says.\n\nLearning who wore various costumes has been intriguing, but understanding how the garments were constructed is even more valuable. Unlike regular clothing, costumes often have unusual features to make a greater impact on stage or to facilitate a quick change of clothing. \u201cThere are often weird things on the insides of them that wouldn\u2019t be put together that way just to walk down the street,\u201d says Hamann. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of magic in there. I wish I could pick the brain of the person who actually made some of these.\u201d\n\nHamann\u00a0would also like to put dates to each garment, but that has been challenging since many of the costumes were created using street clothing from an earlier period, or by\u00a0repurposing\u00a0an existing costume. The same is true today. Students designing costumes for\u00a0SoD\u00a0productions often peruse local thrift shops or the School\u2019s costume collection for items they can modify\u00a0to reflect the goals of a production.\n\nThese vintage costumes won\u2019t be repurposed, and are unlikely to be worn on stage ever again. The fabrics, particularly the silks, are far too fragile for that. But Hamann hopes they can be shared with the public in some other way. \u201cI would love to show them off,\u201d says Hamann. \u201cEventually it would be great if we could do some sort of gallery so the public can see some of this.\u201d\n\nBut first Hamann has more research to do \u2014 on the garments themselves, and the actors who wore them.\n\n\u201cNow more than ever, I wish these items could speak,\u201d she says. \u201cI wish they could tell us about their tour of Seattle and other places. These garments still have a story to tell, and we are in the business of storytelling.\u201d"},{"title":"Solar-powered passion","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/solar-powered-passion\/","tags":["engineering","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["innovation"],"image":"","excerpt":"UW Solar helps civil and environmental engineering students like Alex Ratcliff, \u201919, get hands-on experience with increasing sustainability on our campuses and beyond.","content":"<strong>(College of Engineering, February 2019)<\/strong>\n\nWhen talking about his work to bring solar power to the University of Washington, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering senior Alex Ratcliff lights up.\n\n\u201cUW is ranked the fifth most sustainable college in the U.S.,\u201d said Ratcliff, who is vice president and a project manager for UW Solar. \u201cI\u2019d like to make it number one or two.\u201d\n\nThrough his involvement in <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.uw.edu\/urbanlab\/projects\/uw-solar\/affiliated-faculty-students\/\">UW Solar<\/a>, a student-run organization, Ratcliff has helped bring solar power to three residence halls on campus and has plans to increase the sustainability of even more campus buildings. Overall, UW Solar estimates they have saved the university from producing roughly 270 metric tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to 30,372 gallons of gasoline, 625 barrels of oil, or 295,000 pounds of coal.\n\nWhen Ratcliff arrived on campus as a freshman, he wasn\u2019t an expert on solar power. His involvement in UW Solar was serendipitous, thanks to a flyer he picked up at a career fair during his first quarter on campus. Since then, his passion for a more sustainable campus, and world, has continued to grow.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the most beneficial thing that could have happened to me,\u201d Ratcliff said about his involvement in UW Solar. \u201cClimate change is the greatest threat to human security and health, and I have always wanted to pursue a career that allows me to mitigate or even reverse the effects.\u201d\n\nTwo evenings per week, Ratcliff joins other members of UW Solar to discuss current and future projects. With about 40 members, students are from various disciplines, from engineering to business to urban planning. Since forming in 2013, members have worked toward sustainable power production on campus in order to reduce the overall carbon footprint of the university.\n\n\u201cAlex has always been an enthusiastic participant and a fast learner, so right away he got involved and he\u2019s participated in almost every project since then,\u201d said faculty adviser and associate professor <a href=\"http:\/\/urbdp.be.washington.edu\/people\/jan-whittington\/\">Jan Whittington<\/a>, from the Department of Urban Design and Plan\u00adning.\n\nWhen Ratcliff joined UW Solar, he didn\u2019t have any solar power expertise other than writing a report on solar power while in high school. Acting as consultants, students learn various skills on the job by working on feasibility studies, reviewing designs, submitting projects for bid, and eventually collaborating with contractors to install solar arrays. To secure funding for new projects, members also spend a considerable amount of time writing grant proposals. With a lead role, Ratcliff spends several hours each week searching for and securing new projects and opportunities for the group, which entails giving presentations and meeting with stakeholders.\n\n\u201cI have a good work ethic because of my work with UW Solar. I\u2019ve learned countless skills,\u201d Ratcliff said. \u201cI am more diligent with my time and rather than watch TV, I work on projects that have real meaning and demonstrated effect.\u201d\n\nShortly after joining UW Solar, Ratcliff was tasked with overseeing solar installations on three west campus residence halls: Maple, Alder and Elm halls. For Ratcliff, the project was truly close to home.\n\n\u201cI was living in Maple Hall at the time,\u201d Ratcliff recalled. \u201cDuring my second week with UW Solar, I was labeled as a senior designer. I got to go up on the roof, see the solar arrays installed and monitor them while I was a freshman.\u201d\n\nWith other UW Solar members, Ratcliff was involved in every aspect of the project, from completing a feasibility study to securing funding, including $340,000 from the Washington State Department of Commerce and $225,000 from Seattle City Light.\n\nCompleted in partnership with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cei.washington.edu\/\">Clean Energy Institute<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/hfs.uw.edu\/\">UW Housing &amp; Food Services<\/a> in January 2017, the 100 kW photovoltaic system generates approximately 107,537 kWh per year. The system is also being used as a testbed, providing data to UW researchers who are working to develop more efficient solar energy systems.\n\n\u201cIt has a massive impact on industry as a whole if we can use our infrastructure here for research,\u201d Ratcliff said.\n\nAs UW\u2019s Seattle campus continues to grow, Ratcliff has also been involved in advocating for sustainable features in new buildings. The new\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/csf.uw.edu\/project\/800\">Life Sciences Building<\/a>, which opened in September 2018, features Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) panels on the southern fa\u00e7ade, which provide shade to the building and also generate enough electricity to power the lights on the main floor. This is the second installation of a BIPV system in the state of Washington.\n\n\u201cThe shade gain is really monumental and has a huge impact on cooling of the building, so costs go down tremendously,\u201d Ratcliff said. \u201cWe hope this will be a pioneer for all educational institutions in the country.\u201d\n\nRatcliff also helped design a rooftop solar array for the building, for which funding was recently secured for a full build-out of the system. Construction is anticipated to start this coming summer.\n\nTwo campus master plans will also benefit from Ratcliff\u2019s expertise. To maximize solar photovoltaic capacity on all buildings across campus, he\u2019s helping to develop a 30-year solar energy plan. He is also involved in coordinating sustainable features, such as solar battery storage systems and electric car charging stations, for a second master plan, the Campus Sustainability Plan, which is being developed by <a href=\"https:\/\/green.uw.edu\/\">UW Sustainability<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/transportation.uw.edu\/\">UW Transportation Services<\/a>.\n\nHis efforts don\u2019t stop there. Ratcliff is also working on a feasibility study for solar installations in the UW Greek system, and schematic designs for solar array installations on the new Population Health Building, which is currently under construction, and the new Burke Museum, which opens in fall 2019.\n\n\u201cIn his four years with UW Solar, Alex has gone from being one of the students in learning mode to someone who can now tutor other students,\u201d Whittington said. \u201cNow in his senior year, he is in complete project management mode.\u201d\n\nAs he nears graduation, Ratcliff is considering his career options. He will be part of the first cohort of students to graduate\u00a0with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ce.washington.edu\/future\/undergrad\/environmental\">Bachelor of Science in\u00a0Environmental Engineering degree<\/a>, a new program that launched in 2017. Not surprisingly, he plans to pursue a career in the sustainable building industry, where he hopes to utilize his skillset to produce net positive buildings that clean and produce more water and energy than they use.\n\n\u201cWith solar projects, I can measure and see how many barrels of oil we are offsetting and how much carbon dioxide is not being emitted,\u201d Ratcliff said. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to work on something that I can see fulfilled and have a positive impact.\u201d\n\nIf you are interested in getting involved in UW Solar, contact Alex Ratcliff at\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:alexr529@uw.edu\">alexr529@uw.edu<\/a>\u00a0or Stefanie Young at\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:sy10@uw.edu\">sy10@uw.edu<\/a>.

The team focuses a full-year\u2019s efforts on designing and building a single rocket for competition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe start each year with a new rocket,\u201d says Grant. \u201cBut we are continually iterating on previous years, so you could say that this has been a multi-year process, extending back to the team\u2019s inception in 2009.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">SARP primarily builds hybrid rockets \u2014 rockets that use a combination of solid and liquid fuel. These types tend to be safer than their solid or liquid counterparts but are more complicated to design and construct.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThere\u2019s so much involved in building rockets,\u201d says CSE senior and SARP\u2019s Avionics lead Sabrina Tong. She joined the team a few years ago; SARP needed students with programming and circuitry skills, and she was excited for the opportunity to apply hers to an aerospace-related project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIn addition to technical skills such as programming, system design and analysis, we learn project management and leadership skills,\u201d she says.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At competition, each team usually launches just one rocket, so they hone their efforts into precision design and construction. Successful rockets must launch a payload \u2014 the equipment being transported by the rocket \u2014 and be recovered after flight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">SARP designs its rockets to reach 30,000 feet at a speed of Mach 1.3. Last year, the team\u2019s rocket measured about 14 feet from the tip of the nose cone to the bottom of the fin can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Building a successful \u2014 and safe \u2014 rocket is no easy feat. To get the job done, the team divides into several subteams. The Avionics team focuses on remote fill and launch sequence control, in-flight data and tracking. Structures is concerned with the airframe and other structural components. The Propulsion team develops the motor. Payload designs and creates the item that will be transported inside the rocket (last year\u2019s was an autonomous rover and this year\u2019s is a plasma actuator). The Recovery team determines how to safely recover the rocket, and the Business team is responsible for administration, publicity and sponsorship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">SARP\u2019s rocket is single-use, and competition marks the first \u2014 and only \u2014time it will fly, so everything has to run smoothly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe test components, subsystems and small-scale versions on campus and at remote sites in Oregon and Washington, but usually the only time we get to see the whole rocket fly is at competition,\u201d says Tong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cAs you might imagine, we all get a little anxious on Launch Day,\u201d Grant adds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Three, two, one\u2026lift off!<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cEven though we\u2019re competing, we all have similar anticipation at the moment of lift off,\u201d says Grant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The teams spend three days in the desert preparing for launch. On day one, they set up their base camps, launch pads and guide rails. They also start assembling their rockets, installing payloads and testing subsystems. On day two, they set up remote control stations. Judges review and assess the rockets; those that pass inspection are moved to their respective launch sites.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On the third day, the rockets are ignited, and teams and judges watch from a safe distance as each soars into the air. Environmental elements \u2014 rising temperatures, wind and dust \u2014 can make a launch even more challenging, and sometimes dangerous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Last June, SARP\u2019s was one of 94 rockets that took off during the competition\u2019s launch window.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe were so nervous; our rocket flew straight for about three seconds but then experienced some instability on its ascent to 30,000 feet,\u201d Grant remembers. \u201cOn the descent there was a glitch with parachute deployment. Fortunately we were able to recover the rocket mostly in one piece.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Teams are assessed on everything from written technical reports to design implementation to overall flight performance, recovery and successful payload functionality and landing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite the abnormal flight, SARP\u2019s rocket met its altitude goals, and its construction and engineering impressed the judges. The team took first place in their division.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Team members are now focused on refining last year\u2019s rocket design for next June\u2019s competition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe lessons we learn in our engineering classes are super important, but they\u2019re only part of engineering education,\u201d says Grant. \u201cGetting to build a rocket from scratch with other students who share a passion for rocketry is such a cool project to apply our skills to.

Classmates were equally understanding when they spent time with terrorists, serial killers, Nazis, drug lords, and other nefarious characters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Fortunately none of the characters were real. They were villainous \u201ctypes\u201d that the students brought to life in\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/germanics.washington.edu\/news\/2018\/06\/13\/sympathy-devil-german-385-team-projects-2017\"><span class=\"s2\">Sympathy for the Devil<\/span><\/a>, a 300-level Germanics course. The course explores how sympathy can be used for good but can also have a darker purpose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ellwood Wiggins, assistant professor of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/germanics.washington.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Germanics<\/span><\/a>, created the course to dig into literature\u2019s ability to elicit sympathy. \u201cWhat drew me to literature in the first place was the belief that it can make us better by helping us identify with people from different backgrounds,\u201d says Wiggins. \u201cBut the more I looked into it, the more problematic I realized that was. That\u2019s the engine behind the course.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Wiggins explains that sympathy is a term with several meanings. It can mean compassion for others and their suffering, but it can also mean empathy \u2014 feeling what another person feels. Both forms of sympathy are explored in the course, through philosophical treatises, speeches, plays, novels, and films. With each assigned reading, the class looks closely at the language used to persuade readers. In group assignments, the students then use those same techniques to elicit sympathy for less-than-sympathetic characters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Writers have been doing the same for thousands of years. Compassion was an essential ingredient in Greek tragedy, which is where the course begins. Wiggins has students read\u00a0<i>The Persians<\/i>\u00a0by Aeschylus, first performed in\u00a0472 BC. The play, produced just twelve years after Persia invaded Greece, imagines how the Persians experienced the devastating news of their defeat. \u201cThe existential threat to Greek civilization was put on the stage and imagined from the perspective of the enemy,\u201d says Wiggins. \u201cImagine soon after 9\/11 having a blockbuster film from the point of view of al Qaeda.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The remaining examples in the course, from a Shakespearean play to a Victorian novel to a\u00a01930s\u00a0German film, focus on depictions of Jews, a group that has been demonized as \u201cother\u201d through many centuries and societies. \u201cJews were the \u2018bad guys\u2019 in popular culture for so long,\u201d says Wiggins, \u201cso we look at artistic depictions that try to humanize them, creating admiration or sympathy for them. We look at how the dynamics of that works.\u201d The course then flips that idea, ending with a contemporary Israeli film that features a sympathetic portrayal of a Palestinian terrorist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Current events, including the recent attack on Jewish congregants inside a Pittsburgh synagogue, have reinforced the continuing relevance of the assigned texts. \u201cThe students have been reading\u00a0<i>Nathan the Wise<\/i>\u00a0this weekend,\u201d Ellwood said right after the attack, referring to an 18<\/span><span class=\"s3\">th<\/span><span class=\"s1\">-century drama by German author\u00a0Gotthold\u00a0Ephraim Lessing about a generous and wise Jew. \u201cI can't think of any better answer to hatred than Lessing's play about the need not for tolerance but for respect and friendship between Jews, Christians, and Muslims.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Throughout the quarter, students work in small groups to analyze readings and use what they\u2019ve learned to portray a demonized character sympathetically. Each group plucks a \u201cbad-guy\u201d character from a hat, ranging from a pimp to an abusive mother, and then brainstorms a name, backstory, and motivation for their character. \u00a0Over the following ten weeks they prepare a speech, a dramatic scene, a first-person story, and a visual project to elicit sympathy for their character.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Along the way, ethical questions abound. The class reads Aristotle, for whom compassion is an emotion involving cognitive judgments. They learn that compassion is manipulative and can persuade us of bad things as easily as good. The students also read Adam Smith, who describes all behavior through sympathy, with people acting and reacting to maximize the sympathy they receive. For junior\u00a0Khoi\u00a0Nil, who took the course during his freshman year, those reading assignments were his first exposure to philosophy.\u00a0 \u201cI only realized later that this class was my first contact with ethics,\u201d says Nil, now a philosophy major.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sympathy might sometimes be morally wrong, but the students nevertheless try to inject humanity into their assigned characters. They present their first project\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a five-minute speech\u00a0\u2014\u00a0to the class, with their classmates playing the role of jurors at a sentencing hearing for the character. \u201cThe students who give the speech really ham it up, using humor and sob stories to try to get their fellow students to feel sympathy,\u201d says Wiggins. Based on the speech, the classmates vote on whether there should be leniency in the character\u2019s sentencing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To argue for the black widow who kills her spouse,\u00a0Jobe\u2019s group gave the widow valiant motives and blurred the lines between right and wrong.\u00a0Jobe, now a junior majoring in landscape architecture and comparative history of ideas, says the class has made her more discerning when she reads the news. \u201cI definitely have a more critical lens and a better understanding of the ways that sympathy and empathy can be used to manipulate people,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I also think empathy is extremely important for making more ethical, equitable systems. It\u2019s a constant battle. You have to monitor yourself.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Wiggins agrees. Since the contentious 2016 election, he has added a mini-assignment in which students take on the role of various political types\u00a0\u2014\u00a0die-hard Trump supporters,\u00a0 liberal feminists, non-voters \u2014 and write flash fiction to present their character in a sympathetic light. This, he says, may be the most important assignment of all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIn our society, on both sides of the political spectrum, we tend to see each other as these unsympathetic demons,\u201d says Wiggins. \u201cThere\u2019s this inability to put yourself in the other side\u2019s shoes. Hopefully, after this experience, students don\u2019t immediately pigeonhole people who come to opinions that they think are untenable. The more we practice doing this, the better.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">.\u00a0 .\u00a0 .<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Sympathy for the Devil, offered by the Department of\u00a0Germanics, is cross-listed with Philosophy and Comparative Literature.

But the most powerful weapon may be in your pocket: your cellphone. In cyberwarfare, hackers can potentially control nuclear or defense facilities in enemy nations by finding a back door into their computer networks. And that invasion can begin with malware you unknowingly open on your phone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If that alarms you, don\u2019t expect UW doctoral student Donghui Park, a cybersecurity fellow in the Jackson School of International Studies, to ease your mind. \u201cIn the information age, one teenage hacker can be more powerful than 10,000 soldiers,\u201d says Park, part of the Jackson School\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/jsis.washington.edu\/cybersecurity\"><span class=\"s2\">Cybersecurity Initiative<\/span><\/a>\u00a0team. \u201cOne hacker can control many, many computers.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Park knows a thing or two about warfare. After serving in the military in South Korea, he received his master\u2019s degree in history at Yonsei University and became a professor of military history at the Korean Army Academy. At the UW, Park studies cyberwarfare as the latest dramatic development in the history of weaponry. He believes we are experiencing a paradigm shift, comparable to the introduction of black powder to the West, which led to arrows and swords being replaced by far more destructive canons and rifles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cCyberwarfare is so different from conventional warfare,\u201d Park says. \u201cMy primary question is how nation-states aggressively use cyberspace to maximize their national interests. I\u2019m also interested in cyberwarriors. Who are they? They aren\u2019t trained in the regular army system. Hackers don\u2019t go to military boot camp.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To better understand cyber threats, Park learned coding and studies information technologies with guidance from the Cybersecurity Initiative team, led by Jackson School faculty Jessica Beyer and Sara Curran. Both Beyer and Curran are on Park\u2019s PhD committee, along with Professor Donald Hellmann.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition to reviewing reams of technical reports and official U.S. government warnings related to hacking, Park has interviewed cybersecurity experts in the U.S. and South Korea. Some of the South Korean experts are hackers themselves. \u201cSome of them are monitoring North Korean illegal activity in cyberspace at night, as a hobby,\u201d Park says. \u201cSometimes they post what they have found, or send data to their government.\u201d Park describes these individuals as patriotic hackers because they volunteer information to help their government.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Other hackers, who Park calls contract hackers, are paid through secret contracts to serve as government-funded cyberwarriors, particularly in authoritarian countries. In North Korea, where citizens and most government officials have no access to the Internet, the military provides Internet access for contract hackers to serve the country\u2019s military mission.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Park has identified a third type of hacker that he has dubbed sheltering hackers. They are not connected to the government like contract hackers, but their illegal activities may extend to attacking another country\u2019s critical networks. The hacker\u2019s own government will nevertheless look the other way because the hacking benefits the nation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIn my opinion, every country has all three categories of hackers,\u201d says Park. \u201cThese things are unspoken but are happening everywhere.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Because these cyberwarriors blow up computer networks rather than people, their attacks may seem less brutal. But with the potential to control an enemy\u2019s critical services \u2014 Israeli hackers famously infected Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities with a destructive computer virus in 2010\u00a0\u2014\u00a0they can inflict tremendous damage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Park says citizens can do their part to protect against cyberattacks by promptly installing recommended updates to their computer programs and apps. Those updates often correct software errors that hackers exploit to invade networks. If cyberwarriors do get into your phone or computer \u2014 by sending you an email that unleashes a virus, for example \u2014 they can follow a path of connected networks that may lead to sensitive information. But even with security updates, hackers sometimes find and exploit a glitch before programmers can fix it.\u00a0Once they\u2019re inside a system, they have the potential to wreak havoc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThere is no blood in cyberspace but there is incredible danger,\u201d says Park, \u201cwhich is why the U.S. military\u2019s new head of cybercommand is a four-star general. Cyberspace is the new battlefield along with air, sea, land, and space. It\u2019s the new domain. As a military historian, I anticipate I will be studying cyberwarfare for years to come.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">. . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Learn more about the Jackson School\u2019s\u00a0<\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/jsis.washington.edu\/research\/ipi\/\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>International Policy Institute<\/i><\/span><\/a><i>\u00a0and its\u00a0<\/i><a href=\"http:\/\/jsis.washington.edu\/cybersecurity\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>Cybersecurity Initiative<\/i><\/span><\/a><i>, which are supported through funding by Carnegie Corporation of New York.<\/i><\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Playing with fire","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/playing-with-fire\/","tags":["arts-sciences","faculty","giving"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"With ingenuity and perseverance, faculty and staff built the UW glass program one kiln at a time.","content":"<strong>(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, November 2018)<\/strong>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>\u201cIt\u2019s like being in the middle of a volcano.

The way it moves between liquid states and solid states is a beautiful thing.\u201d<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mark Zirpel is talking about glass, a material he finds endlessly fascinating. That makes sense given that Zirpel heads the glass program in the UW\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/art.washington.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">School of Art + Art History + Design<\/span><\/a>\u00a0(SoA+AH+D) \u2014 a program he built from the ground up after joining the faculty in 2008 as the Dale Chihuly Endowed Chair of Glass.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It hasn\u2019t been easy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When\u00a0Zirpel\u00a0arrived, the Pacific Northwest was already a hub for glass. Since the\u00a01970s, many glass artists have located in the Northwest thanks to the esteemed\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pilchuck.com\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Pilchuck\u00a0Glass School<\/span><\/a>, established by UW alumnus Dale\u00a0Chihuly\u00a0(BA, 1965). But the University of Washington had no glass program. A group of philanthropic art collectors recognized the need and created the\u00a0Chihuly\u00a0Endowed Chair of Glass to support a faculty position and fund a new building with glass studios, faculty offices, and a gallery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cA graduate architecture class designed three absolutely spectacular studios and created models,\u201d Zirpel recalls. \u201cAnd then the economy tanked and things unraveled from there.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With the recession, the new building was no longer a possibility. The School began offering glass classes at Pratt Fine Arts Center in Seattle\u2019s Central District, and then in the UW\u2019s Ceramic and Metal Arts (CMA) Building. With limited resources but an abundance of determination, Zirpel set out to acquire glass-working equipment on a shoestring budget.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Zirpel\u00a0had to prioritize since the four main techniques for working with glass require different equipment.\u00a0<i>Kilnforming<\/i>, including techniques like fused and molded glass, uses kilns that reach 1500 degrees.\u00a0<i>Cold glass<\/i>, usually a finishing technique for other processes, requires specialized saws, drills, and sanders for grinding and polishing.\u00a0<i>Flameworking\u00a0<\/i>involves heating and manipulating glass using an oxy-propane torch.\u00a0<i>Hot glass or blown glass<\/i>\u00a0requires a furnace that can melt glass into molten liquid and kilns that serve as\u00a0annealers\u00a0to slowly cool the material.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ramping up facilities for kilnforming, cold glass, and flameworking\u00a0took nearly four years and ingenuity, including building several kilns from scratch and negotiating an affordable supply of raw material. Adding a hot glass studio took another four years. Sean O\u2019Neill, instructional technician for the program and an experienced glassblower, was able to secure two electric furnaces\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/artsci.washington.edu\/news\/2012-12\/hot-gift-glassblowing\"><span class=\"s2\">donated by Glassybaby<\/span><\/a>, and a bounty of used equipment from a glass studio that was closing. \u201cThe furnaces were\u00a0<i>very<\/i>\u00a0well used, so I took them down to the bones and reassembled them into one that would work well,\u201d says O\u2019Neill.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Zirpel\u00a0identified a covered area outside the CMA Building that could function as an area for hot glass, but there was still the matter of bringing electricity to the site. Hot glass requires enough power to run a furnace at sustained temperatures of 2000 degrees or more, while also powering pick-up ovens, kilns and other equipment. \u201cTo run electricity to the site was really costly,\u201d says\u00a0Zirpel. \u201cIt would have taken years of my budget just to get the power there.\u201d To help the program over this final hurdle, College of Arts &amp; Sciences Dean Robert Stacey dedicated College funds for the electrical work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">With the glass program fully operational, students now have enviable opportunities to explore. But first they must overcome fears about working with furnaces and molten material.\u00a0 \u201cPeople\u2019s instinct is to want to stay away from the heat, which is the opposite of what needs to happen,\u201d says O\u2019Neill. \u201cYou have to get them to move forward into a zone of discomfort so they can be more efficient. As soon as you get glass out of the furnace it starts cooling off and becoming harder to work with, so you can\u2019t be tentative.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Some students, like junior\u00a0Candise\u00a0Salinas, are drawn to the medium.\u00a0Salinas came to the UW with glassblowing experience and has relished opportunities to explore all the glass program offerings. (Her favorites are kilnforming\u00a0and\u00a0flameworking.) \u201cI\u2019m excited to have access to so many tools and the space to use them,\u201d says Salinas. \u201cI\u2019ve never found any other place that has all the resources, people, and great connections to the local glass community that I have here at the University of Washington.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Thanks to those connections,\u00a0Zirpel\u00a0has invited guest artists \u2014 as many as four during an academic quarter\u00a0\u2014\u00a0to contribute in a variety of ways.

Anne-Lise Nilsen, '14, is making sure he's prepared.","content":"<strong>(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, January 2019)<\/strong>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Anne-Lise Nilsen\u2019s career has gone to the dogs. She wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Nilsen (BS, Psychology, 2014) is the trainer for Dubs II, the successor to the UW\u2019s newly retired canine mascot Dubs. As trainer, she chose the puppy who will be the new furry face of the Huskies and is preparing Dubs II for his very public role.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cDubs paved the way for Dubs II,\u201d Nilsen says. \u201cWhen Dubs started, he did a handful of events throughout the year. He\u2019s now at upwards of 40 events a year, and he leads the team out at football games. There\u2019s so much he\u2019s been able to do as the University\u2019s mascot.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Nilsen\u00a0has nearly two decades of experience working with dogs, starting with her first bichon\u00a0fris\u00e9 puppy at age 7. She discovered a love for dog training through Dog 4H in Seattle. As a teen she competed in youth events with the American Kennel Club, once making it to the\u00a0Bichon\u00a0Fris\u00e9\u00a0Nationals. \u00a0Around the same time, she developed a dog training lesson plan to help pet owners in her bichon\u00a0fris\u00e9 play group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a student at Seattle\u2019s Ballard High School, Nilsen completed a research project on social hierarchy in dogs. For advice on research methods, she reached out to animal behavior specialist James Ha, UW professor of psychology (now emeritus). \u201cHe was extremely welcoming,\u201d Nilsen recalls of Ha, who continues to be a mentor. \u201cHe helped me with all the stats, and later got me to present my research at an Animal Behavior Society meeting.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Through Ha, Nilsen learned that the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/psych.uw.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">UW Department of Psychology<\/span><\/a>\u00a0offers an emphasis in animal behavior. She loved the idea of a psychology degree, which she felt would inform her work with dog owners as well as their four-legged companions. For her psychology honors thesis, Nilsen once again worked with Ha, studying how different dog breeds relearn a task when some aspect of the task changes. She liked that the research, an exploration of animal cognition, had direct application to her dog-training work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dubs was among the 25 dogs in Nilsen\u2019s honor thesis study. She had begun working with him sophomore year, as one of four or five student handlers overseeing Dubs\u2019 event appearances. Student handlers serve as Dubs\u2019 advocates at events and report any concerns, from unusual behavior to challenging conditions that might require further training. \u201cThere are always things that change,\u201d says Nilsen. \u201cAthletics may add fireworks during game day, or change the order of things Dubs is expected to do. All of that requires extra learning.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Nilsen continued as a student handler until graduation, and later was hired to train the handlers in addition to her day job as manager of a doggy day care in Mukilteo, Washington. Given her history with Dubs, it\u2019s no surprise that\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/gohuskies.com\/\"><span class=\"s2\">UW Athletics<\/span><\/a>\u00a0asked her to lead the search for, and training of, his canine successor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Nilsen\u2019s dogged (ahem) search led to a puppy from a local breeder, with classic markings and an even temperament. \u201cSomething would change in his environment and he wouldn\u2019t spook,\u201d Nilsen recalls. \u201cHe would just sit back and let whatever it was happen, and then investigate, which is exactly the type of temperament that can succeed in a stadium full of Husky fans.\u201d Nilsen also helped choose Dubs II\u2019s family, to ensure a happy home life when he is off the clock. (Yes, it\u2019s a family of Husky alums.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite being the Husky mascot, Dubs and Dubs II are not huskies. They are\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alaskan_Malamute\"><span class=\"s2\">malamutes<\/span><\/a>, a closely related breed that tends to be larger and more opinionated. \u201cI like malamutes for this type of role because chaos is less likely to rattle a malamute than the Siberian husky,\u201d Nilsen explains. \u201cBeing a Nordic breed, they are one of the breeds genetically closest to wolves, and because of that they tend to be independent thinkers. But if you set them up to succeed by giving them the right tools and rewards, they are typically very intelligent in addition to being good with people, including children.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Following Dubs long reign as UW\u2019s top dog, Dubs II has big paws to fill. To ensure his success,\u00a0Nilsen\u00a0began training him at eight weeks, slowly acclimating him to the massive stadium and camera flashes and overeager fans that will be part of his life. Once he is fully matured, he will attend 40 or more events a year, with\u00a0Nilsen\u00a0reviewing every event request to ensure his well-being.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Though Dubs II will not reach adulthood for another year, he was officially anointed as the UW\u2019s new canine mascot in November, at a passing-of-the-collar ceremony in Husky Stadium during the last home game. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those bittersweet things,\u201d says\u00a0Nilsen. \u201cI\u00a0didn\u2019t want to see Dubs retire because that was my college experience. He was my first love when it comes to malamutes. But now having Dubs II as this all-encompassing project, it is so much fun to see all that he is becoming and all that he can do. There are so many things I learned from Dubs that I\u2019m now applying to Dubs II.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With Dubs II\u2019s \u201cred shirt season\u201d complete,\u00a0Nilsen\u00a0will ramp up the training of his student handlers, who will eventually accompany Dubs II on his mascot duties without\u00a0Nilsen\u00a0present. But\u00a0Nilsen\u00a0will continue to prepare Dubs II for new challenges and opportunities as they arise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe University\u2019s live mascot program has so much growth potential,\u201d says\u00a0Nilsen. \u00a0\u201cI hope to be a part of the program for years to come. It\u2019s such a cool way to stay involved with the University.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Destined to dance","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/destined-to-dance\/","tags":["alumni","arts-sciences"],"pillars":["public-good","student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Through dance, Cheryl Delostrinos, '13, promotes equity and social justice \u2014 and the joy of movement.","content":"<strong>(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, January 2019)<\/strong>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dancers spend years training to be choreographers.

All collective members identify as artists of color, queer artists, trans artists, or femme artists. They created the collective as \u201ca space where we can show up as ourselves,\u201d\u00a0Delostrinos\u00a0says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Delostrino\u2019s first introduction to concert-based dance was another company known for its diverse voices: Alvin Ailey Dance Company. \u00a0She was captivated by an Ailey performance in UW\u2019s Meany Hall, which she attended with her first grade class through Meany\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/meanycenter.org\/engage\/free-student-matinees\"><span class=\"s2\">Student Matinee Series<\/span><\/a>. Soon after, dancers from Pacific Northwest Ballet (PNB) visited her school and chose a handful of students to attend a weekly dance class through the PNB DanceChance program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI was in love with dance and I wasn\u2019t chosen,\u201d Delostrinos recalls. \u201cI was really bummed out, watching my friends take their leotards and tights and leave early on Fridays.\u201d After months of pining, she convinced her parents to sign her up for classes at a neighborhood dance studio. In an ironic twist, a year later she auditioned and was chosen for the PNB School \u2014 far more selective than the DanceChance program she\u2019d missed out on previously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cFrom eight years old, I was spending every day after school dancing or in rehearsal or performing,\u201d says\u00a0Delostrinos, who also continued studying at her neighborhood studio. \u201cThat was my life for most of my K-12 years.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As she headed for college, Delostrinos envisioned a career as a professional dancer. Her parents had other ideas. They hoped her aptitude for science would lead to a medical degree. \u201cI\u2019m Filipinx, from a family of immigrants,\u201d Delostrinos explains. \u201cMy family did not understand what a career in the art world could look like, especially since there\u2019s not much representation of Filipino women in that world in Seattle.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a compromise, Delostrinos planned to double major in dance and a science discipline at the UW. Her freshman year she focused on science, but dance kept calling her back. A summer internship with Alvin Ailey Dance Company solidified her commitment to dance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI came back to the UW sophomore year really hungry to create,\u201d Delostrinos recalls. \u201cI had a curiosity about what it looks like for dance to evolve, and to explore how dance relates to who I am. The faculty in the Dance Program [now the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dance.washington.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Department of Dance<\/span><\/a>] just opened their doors to all of it. I would come in asking, \u2018What if I tried this?\u2019 And they would say, \u2018Yes! Do that \u2014 and more!\u2019 The program fosters a space that is inclusive, open, and willing to change based on the artists who are in that space. That is unique in the dance world. I felt really supported in exploring new ideas.\u201dAfter graduating, Delostrinos toured with Seattle-based Pat Graney Dance Company, danced on other local projects, and taught dance at Seattle Academy of Arts and Sciences. She enjoyed her jobs, but she missed creating work that fully represented who she is as a dancer of color. Three UW friends shared similar frustrations, and together they dreamed up Au Collective. (Delostrinos explains that Au is the periodic symbol for gold, a cultural symbol for celebration.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Au Collective began with performances at pop-up events at breweries and art festivals. The group quickly grew to a dozen dancers\u00a0\u2014\u00a0all UW alumni\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and made a splash with sold-out performances at 12<\/span><span class=\"s3\">th<\/span><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0Avenue Arts in Seattle. By late 2015, they had raised $15,000 through a crowdfunding campaign, and the co-founders \u2014\u00a0Delostrinos, Hallie Scott, Austin Nguyen, and\u00a0Fausto\u00a0Rivera\u00a0\u2014\u00a0took on administrative roles while holding down day jobs. \u201cThings started happening really fast,\u201d recalls\u00a0Delostrinos, who served as artistic and executive director. \u201cWe received a lot of requests to perform. We spent a solid six months performing every weekend.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Overwhelmed by their unexpected success, the collective paused to regroup. They changed the leadership structure to ensure greater equity, and pared the membership to eight dancers, all with equal say.\u00a0 They also established bylaws and a board.\u00a0 Au Collective continues to perform \u2014 including recent projects for the Seattle Art Museum, PNB, and Wing Luke Museum\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but also partners with Coyote Central on programs for youth interested in dance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Today\u00a0Delostrinos\u00a0balances her Au Collective work with a full-time job as arts manager for\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.artscorps.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Arts Corps<\/span><\/a>, an organization that promotes access to youth arts education. As she coordinates Arts Corps programs at 30 sites in King County, her dance background informs her work. \u201cI\u2019ve been able to incorporate a strong dance foundation rooted in the idea of having agency over your body, having a voice, and telling your story,\u201d she says.

He achieved his goal, earning a UW bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016. But he\u2019s never forgotten the stress of navigating the college application and financial aid process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That experience inspired Truong to create\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.heymentor.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Hey Mentor<\/span><\/a>, an online mentor program for high school students. Since its launch in fall 2017, Hey Mentor has served students from more than 20 high schools in King County, and has earned the attention and support of the Gates Foundation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Truong had years of experience with college readiness programs before launching his own. As a UW undergraduate, he spent four years volunteering for\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/dreamproject\/\"><span class=\"s2\">The Dream Project<\/span><\/a>, which supports college access and post-secondary planning for middle and high school students. His junior and senior years, he also held a staff position with The Dream Project. After graduating, Truong became a full-time college access coach at Seattle\u2019s Chief Sealth High School\u00a0\u2014\u00a0his alma mater\u00a0\u2014\u00a0through AmeriCorps\u2019\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.collegeaccessnow.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\">College Access Now<\/span><\/a>\u00a0program. He wanted to continue exploring college readiness as a career path but noticed shortcomings in existing programs, particularly their struggles to retain mentors and high school participants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI started thinking critically about why that was happening and realized that the traditional access model of sending mentors out to high schools\u00a0wasn\u2019t working very well,\u201d\u00a0Truong\u00a0explains. \u201cThe Dream Project would send college mentors to high schools up to 45 minutes away, and sometimes only a handful of high school students would show up. That\u00a0wasn\u2019t the fault of the volunteers or the students. High school seniors are just very busy with sports and clubs and all the things going on after school, so it\u2019s hard to meet with the college mentors. I thought there had to be a better way to reach students where they\u2019re at. I decided to create Hey Mentor as an online model, using my experience to do something innovative and different than what was currently being offered.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Through Hey Mentor, students are assigned an online mentor whom they can contact with questions or concerns at their convenience. The mentors are college students or recent college graduates trained in college access issues\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the admissions process, financial aid\u00a0\u2014\u00a0as well as social and emotional aspects of mentor relationships. When possible, mentors are paired with high school students with similar career interests.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Truong\u00a0began planning Hey Mentor while wrapping up his year-long AmeriCorps stint at Chief\u00a0Sealth\u00a0High School. He invited Chief\u00a0Sealth\u00a0students to brainstorm with him, meeting with them weekly during the spring and summer. Together they developed a plan for recruiting high school students, a curriculum for training mentors, a name for the program, and a logo. By fall 2017 \u2014 when\u00a0Truong\u00a0returned to the UW to begin a master\u2019s program in public administration\u2014 he had filed for nonprofit status and created a Hey Mentor board.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Thanks to\u00a0Truong\u2019s many connections at local high schools and with former college readiness mentors, he was able to launch Hey Mentor that fall. He formed a technology team to develop a mobile app, and a new Hey Mentor student club at the UW recruited and trained more than 30 additional volunteers. Student ambassadors from a dozen Seattle-area high schools spread the word about the program, and a $15,000 grant from the Gates Foundation led to more program refinements.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As if juggling graduate school and Hey Mentor\u00a0wasn\u2019t enough,\u00a0Truong\u00a0also worked as an admissions reader for the UW Office of Admissions in autumn 2017, which meant reading upwards of 1000 college applications over three months. The experience gave him a greater understanding of what admissions staff look for in applicants, and became one more way to help high school students. \u201cI\u2019ve never shared any trade secrets with applicants,\u201d\u00a0Truong\u00a0assures. \u201cI was very transparent with Admissions about my dual role.\u201d Hey Mentor is now an affiliated program with UW Admissions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Beyond online mentoring, Hey Mentor now offers hands-on workshops, including a college application workshop for high school seniors and a mock admissions day for juniors. For the latter\u00a0\u2014 Hey Mentors\u2019 most popular event\u00a0\u2014 high school juniors complete an abbreviated college application, then learn from mentors what they can do to improve their chances of acceptance at selective schools.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cHey Mentor\u2019s online program makes mentors more accessible to students, and the in-person activities complement the online experience,\u201d says\u00a0Truong. \u201cThey are another way to engage students. I tried to identify what other organizations were\u00a0<i>not<\/i>\u00a0doing\u00a0\u2014 things I could introduce to make Hey Mentor more fun and increase retention.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Truong\u00a0hopes Hey Mentor can continue to broaden its reach, with Hey Mentor clubs at other universities in Washington state and beyond. Given his own background, he understands what a difference a little help can make.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI grew up in a low-income community, with parents who came to the U.S. from Vietnam,\u201d says\u00a0Truong. \u201cMy mom had to drop out in second grade to take care of younger siblings, and my dad dropped out in fifth grade.

It really helped me figure out patient care from the nurse\u2019s perspective.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">After spending a year working and attending workshops at the UW to sharpen her application essay, Sukrachan applied to the School of Nursing a third time \u2014 and got in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">\u201cGetting patient experience alongside a nurse practitioner made all the difference for Srinya,\u201d says Chow. \u201cShe fully understood what kind of relationships she wanted to have with her patients, and she was one of the strongest applicants.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Serving others<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">With the help of several scholarships, Sukrachan could fully embrace her student experience the second time around. \u201cThat support definitely took a huge burden off. I didn\u2019t have to work my first year, so I could focus on my studies,\u201d she says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Sukrachan also took on the role of volunteer coordinator for Nurse Camp for two years and co-founded\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/nursing.uw.edu\/students\/clubs\/future-nurses\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Future Nurses Club<\/span><\/a>, a registered student organization that provides pre- and current nursing students \u2014 especially those from underrepresented and underserved communities \u2014 with advice, networking opportunities and tips on the application process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt felt so right,\u201d says Sukrachan. \u201cWe had just finished volunteering at Nurse Camp, which provides amazing opportunities for high schoolers. We thought, \u2018Why can\u2019t we do the same for minority, low-income students at the UW who want to get into our program?\u2019\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Says Chow, \u201cStarting a student organization like Future Nurses Club takes considerable work and commitment, but Srinya was focused on giving back. She\u2019s a true role model.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Today, Sukrachan is an antepartum nurse at Swedish Hospital\u2019s First Hill campus, caring for women with high-risk pregnancies.

The merit-based Urban Design and Planning Scholarship and a scholarship from the Myer R.

He joined his department\u2019s diversity committee, which brings students and faculty together to make the college more welcoming, inclusive and equitable for all students, from what they read to who they hear from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Last year, the committee audited reading lists for all of the urban planning program\u2019s core classes, noting the gender and ethnicity of authors, and shared the results with program faculty. \u201cThey may not make wholesale changes to their curriculum,\u201d says Campbell, \u201cbut it\u2019s enough to have them say, \u2018Maybe we need to take a look at that and update it.\u2019\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The committee also brings to campus underrepresented voices in the urban design and planning field, broadening students\u2019 perspectives and identifying challenges they may someday face. \u201cWe invite planners and community engagers of color to come talk about projects they\u2019re working on and the ways it may have been difficult for them to work in Seattle,\u201d says Campbell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Beyond the classroom<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">In order to apply his education to helping local communities, Campbell began serving on his neighborhood\u2019s land-use committee. \u201cSo far I\u2019ve learned how the community engagement process works and how neighborhood associations can communicate with the city from a very grassroots level,\u201d he says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">With the goal of deepening the connection between his studies and the real world, Campbell began a yearlong graduate internship with the Seattle Department of Transportation over the summer. Working in the department\u2019s street-use division, he reviews new building projects to make sure they\u2019re safe and legal and don\u2019t interfere with public use of city streets.

For the past three weeks, Giles has been working here in residency, creating a new series of works on paper. Now the Chicago-based artist is showing UW sophomore Serena Lantz how to hang his unframed work at eye level using a self-designed system of pins and carefully crafted paper hinges.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Behind every exhibition\u2019s public face is a team of professionals who work long hours to put it all together. At the Jacob Lawrence Gallery, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this month, this team includes undergraduate and graduate students who are gaining valuable hands-on experience through the School of Art + Art History + Design\u2019s curatorial internship program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Learning by doing<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Lantz is earning a B.A. in studio art with a concentration in\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/art.washington.edu\/art\/ba-art-3d4m-concentration\"><span class=\"s2\">3D4M<\/span><\/a>, the University\u2019s interdisciplinary designation for three-dimensional art. This quarter, after spending a year as a curatorial intern, they are moving into a paid position as the gallery lead, working closely with gallery director Emily Zimmerman on several aspects of day-to-day operations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe generally have around 15 interns,\u201d says Lantz, who grew up on Seattle\u2019s Eastside. \u201cWe have positions in social media, graphic design \u2014 I like to think it\u2019s a system where you choose what you want to learn.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">One of Lantz\u2019s favorite aspects of gallery work is the way it encourages conversations with visitors. \u201cIf you\u2019re a studio artist, it\u2019s important to be able to communicate with other creative people about art,\u201d they say. \u201cIt\u2019s also given me a lot of opportunities to reflect about the gallery not only as a physical space, but also as a social space in the context of artists and representation.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Other responsibilities involve handling the art itself. \u201cWe encourage interns to be part of the install and deinstall process,\u201d says Lantz. \u201cThis is a core part of the experience, because you\u2019re able to interact with the work on a personal level \u2014 meet the artist and have discussions with them.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Art handling is also an opportunity to gain practical skills, Lantz adds: \u201c\u2018How do I patch a hole in a wall? How do I paint?\u2019 Even if they don\u2019t decide to go into curatorial work, the experience of working in a gallery is invaluable to people who are considering art as a profession.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Knowledge into practice<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s3\">\u201cTo me, the legacy of Jacob Lawrence is at the intersection of arts and social justice,\u201d says assistant curator\u00a0Juan Franco.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The Jacob Lawrence Gallery\u2019s assistant curator, art history master\u2019s candidate Juan Franco, will have the chance to put this functional knowledge to use over the summer by curating \u201cLugar del Trabajo,\u201d an exhibition at the gallery by New York\u2013based artists Ang\u00e9lica Maria Mill\u00e1n Lozano and Camilo Godoy that will serve as Franco\u2019s thesis practicum project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In the meantime, Franco has been assisting Zimmerman with \u201cThe Practice and Science of Drawing a Sharp White Background,\u201d the current exhibition by Giles, whose work interrogates currents of white supremacy running through Eurocentric art history curricula. Giles is this year\u2019s recipient of the Jacob Lawrence Legacy Residency, a program established in 2015 to help carry forward the values of the former UW professor for whom the gallery is named.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIn honoring Jacob Lawrence\u2019s legacy, the gallery has a mission to support those things that were important to Lawrence: education, social justice and experimentation,\u201d says Zimmerman, who became the gallery\u2019s director in 2017. \u201cSupporting the creation of new artwork that is in dialogue with the inequities embedded in our social, political and economic realities is crucial as a tool for seeing our world anew.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Living a legacy<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This mission resonates strongly with both Lantz and Franco, who share an interest in issues of identity and tradition in the context of cultural production. \u201cTo me, the legacy of Jacob Lawrence is at the intersection of arts and social justice,\u201d says Franco. \u201cTalking about history from a particular viewpoint and also advocating for it, making it visual to experience \u2014 the gallery is a place where all these histories come together.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Zimmerman says that she would like the students who work for the gallery to take away an understanding of the care at the core of curatorial practice. \u201cThis means not only looking after the physical safety of artworks, but also one\u2019s responsibility to the artist, the audience, colleagues and community,\u201d she says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">These are far-reaching lessons that students will carry with them into the future. \u201cWorking at the Jacob Lawrence Gallery encourages me to consider artistic work and practice as both personal expression and political, societal act,\u201d says Lantz. \u201cI\u2019m proud of everything we do to establish and solidify the connection between arts and social justice.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s3\"><b>Advocating for the arts<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s3\">When you support the Friends of the Jacob Lawrence Gallery fund, you can help students like Serena Lantz and Juan Franco gain the experience they need to pursue careers in the arts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/giving\/make-a-gift\/?page=funds&amp;source_typ=3&amp;source=ARTDIS\"><b>GIVE NOW<\/b><b><\/b><\/a><\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Building bridges","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/building-bridges-2\/","tags":["alumni","arts-sciences","giving"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"From a small Washington town to one of the world's largest cities, Caleb Huffman is on a quest to connect with others \u2014 and expand his own perspective in the process.","content":"(UW homepage, 2018)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Caleb Huffman, \u201918, admits that his transition to the University of Washington was daunting. The number of undergraduates alone is 30 times larger than the population of his rural Washington hometown, Onalaska.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">But four years later, the UW senior is again on the cusp of uprooting himself to a much larger city. This fall, he\u2019ll move to Beijing to spend two years studying Chinese law and society at Peking University.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Why does\u00a0Huffman embrace such drastic changes of scenery? It\u2019s part of his quest to connect with others\u00a0despite \u2014 and because of \u2014 their many differences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Urban-rural roots<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In third grade, Huffman moved from Renton, an economically and racially diverse city south of Seattle, to Onalaska. \u201cIt was the complete opposite,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I consider myself someone who\u2019s been able to bridge the urban-rural divide, and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve remained very interested in.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">When he was accepted to the UW, Huffman knew he wanted to major in both political science and communication. But first he had to find a way to pay for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Federal loans, financial aid and the State Need Grant went a long way, but they still left a significant gap. Then the philanthropically supported\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/huskypromise\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Husky Promise<\/span><\/a>, which covers tuition and fees for Washington state students from low-income families, brought him over the finish line. \u201cThe support I received made all the difference,\u201d he says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Exploring differences<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Without a financial burden to worry about, Huffman hit the ground running at the UW, participating in several campus groups and exploring his interest in building bridges between communities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The UW chapter of the Veritas Forum, where Huffman would eventually serve as student director, had a strong impact on him. The faith-based organization\u2019s tagline is \u201cPursuing Truth Together,\u201d and as a Christian, Huffman enjoyed engaging with people from different belief systems to discuss some of life\u2019s most difficult questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe\u2019re not omniscient as humans,\u201d he says. \u201cThe information we\u2019ve processed only gives us a certain slice of the world, which is inherently going to be limited.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">After his first year at the UW, Huffman pushed himself even further by traveling outside the U.S. for the first time. He went to Rome with the support of a grant from the U.S. Department of State, which he learned about through the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/uaa\/excelling\/office-of-merit-scholarships-fellowships-and-awards\/\"><span class=\"s2\">UW Office of Merit Scholarships, Fellowships and Awards<\/span><\/a>\u00a0(OMSFA). In addition to studying global cities and human migrations, he volunteered at a refugee center.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI met a lot of political refugees, and their stories were just heartbreaking,\u201d he says. \u201cI got really interested in international relations after that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>A global community<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In his sophomore year, Huffman was accepted into the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/globalaffairs\/hpa\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Husky Presidential Ambassadors Leadership Institute<\/span><\/a>, which matches current UW students with incoming first-year students from China to develop cross-cultural communication and leadership skills. After a week of leadership prep on campus, Huffman spent two weeks with his cohort at Tsinghua University in Beijing, where they studied alongside newly admitted UW international students who would be moving to Seattle in the fall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s really easy for international students to remain in their communities at the UW,\u201d says Huffman. \u201cSome study abroad in the United States, but they never truly \u2018leave\u2019 their country. This program is trying to bridge that divide.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Huffman\u2019s growing interest in U.S.\u2013China relations made him want to return and keep learning. With more help from OMSFA, he was selected to participate in two international bridge-building programs with conferences in the U.S. and China. He spent part of last summer in Chengdu, improving his Mandarin and learning more about China\u2019s culture. And he\u2019s involved in the Gorton Center Global Leaders Program through the National Bureau of Asian Research, focusing on policy and business leadership.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cHumans are similar in a lot of ways, but our differences are there \u2014 and sometimes you can\u2019t see them,\u201d Huffman says. \u201cThat matters because when you\u2019re making policy, if you don\u2019t know about those differences, you might hurt people.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The next stage of the journey<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Ultimately, Huffman hopes to become a lawyer, working in the U.S. legal system to help strengthen our country\u2019s relationship with China and contribute to a more peaceful world. But first he\u2019s heading back to China for graduate school to deepen his understanding of its legal system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe U.S.\u2013China relationship will be the most critical bilateral relationship of my lifetime.

There are seven billion people in the world. What community are you going to find? Where are you going to go?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What makes Caleb tick<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">When he\u2019s not planning his next trip to China, Caleb Huffman is extremely active on the UW campus.

Since its founding in 1982, the nonprofit air ambulance service has transported more than 100,000 critically ill and injured patients to medical centers throughout Washington, Alaska, Idaho, and Montana.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Speed and efficiency are critical to patient outcomes. That girl who slipped off a cliff may have only an hour to live without life-saving rescue and medical treatment. Time is of the essence. So the air ambulance service was game when a team of Information School\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/ischool.uw.edu\/informatics\"><span class=\"s2\">Informatics<\/span><\/a>\u00a0students proposed developing a new communications tool with the potential to streamline airlift operations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe thought we could help them move forward in the technology space. Health care is behind in that sense,\u201d says Tiffany Chen, user experience and software engineer for the four-member team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The tool, called Elevate, is a mobile-friendly web application that acts as a connective communication hub, allowing Airlift Northwest crews to instantly view mission-critical data as it is entered and updated by dispatch after an emergency call comes in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A touch of the finger shows a wealth of mission data: the status of the aircraft, where it\u2019s based, whether it\u2019s a fixed wing plane or helicopter; the estimated time of takeoff, pickup, and arrival at destination; the names of pilots and flight nurses onboard; important contact information; what extra medical equipment is needed; and more. The app provides the highly skilled Airlift Northwest nurses \u2013 each with at least five years of critical care experience \u2013 mission data on patients (minus identifying information, for privacy reasons). That data includes vital statistics, patient condition (Is the man intubated? The pregnant woman dilated?), and their medical requirements in flight (IVs? Respirator? Plasma? Blood?).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The app is a big tech step forward for\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.uwmedicine.org\/airlift-nw\"><span class=\"s2\">Airlift Northwest<\/span><\/a>, a nonprofit entity of University of Washington Medicine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cRight now, crews are using three or four different modes of communication: pagers, SMS text messages, radio, and phone. Our project reduces reliance on them and adds rich contextual notifications about a new mission request,\u201d says Chen, whose team members include product owner and developer J. Benjamin Leeds, developer Jessica Basa, and product designer and developer Vincent van der Meulen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">They took on the challenge for their 2018 iSchool\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/ischool.uw.edu\/capstone\"><span class=\"s2\">Capstone<\/span><\/a>\u00a0project. The iSchool projects put students\u2019 academics into action in the real world, culminating their learning at the school. Their project began with a four-way brainstorm. What were the team\u2019s common interests? Chen and Basa had a special interest in health care; Leeds, a certified pilot, was interested in aviation. All wanted to make an impact \u2013 an impact that would last long after the May 30 Capstone presentation night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe looked for an organization that matched our interests, and reached out to Airlift Northwest,\u201d says Leeds, who initially made contact with the company\u2019s personnel through Facebook. \u201cThen began the dialogue on what we\u2019d be able to do in our timeframe that would add the most value to the organization.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To optimize user input, team members spent one day each week interviewing employees in various roles throughout Airlift Northwest headquarters in Seattle. \u201cWe sat down with them, watched them do their work, and asked them about the problems they encountered, possible things we could solve,\u201d says Van der Meulen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The students regularly returned with new design possibilities for more rounds of questions and feedback. \u201cWe made so many changes to get it to where it is,\u201d says Leeds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">A key problem that emerged was the difficulty of dispatch and flight crews exchanging information in real, or near-real time. \u201cDuring a mission, there is a need to communicate accurately, early, and often,\u201d says Airlift Northwest\u2019s Technology Manager Chris Carlton-Bishop, who describes the iSchool students as \u201cprofessionals\u201d who stirred up ideas and delivered on all their commitments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">\u201cWorking with a team of young developers brings energy and excitement to the business far beyond the applications,\u201d he says. \u201cThe nurses who had a chance to interact with the team are excited about what they were developing, the IT team was energized by working in relevant technologies, and the leadership was challenged, in a good way, to think about how those outside the day-to-day operations see things in a different light and offer innovative solutions.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Designing a high-functioning app in a complicated scenario where lives are at stake was a huge challenge for team members. Their product had to be compliant with both HIPAA regulations (patient confidentiality and information security) and FAA guidelines, and it had to address a myriad of concerns.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">\u201cThis is a very complex space. We are working in aviation and health care, fields that you can spend your whole life studying and still not know everything about,\u201d says Leeds. \u201cWe had to leverage what we knew from informatics courses about design thinking and contextual inquiry and determine how to proceed: How is this communication flowing and how do we build technology to address it? It was like drinking from a firehose.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">One challenge was data delivery. Different users of the Elevate app see different data, depending on their role. Pilots, for instance, do not see patient information \u2013 information that could influence their risk assessments. \u201cIt\u2019s so they can make rational decisions regardless of what is happening with the patient in the back of the aircraft,\u201d says Leeds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">To ensure app reliability, flight nurses, pilots, and dispatchers are all connected to the application on the Google Cloud platform. There, modern technologies like Kubernetes and a team of Google Reliability Engineers are constantly ensuring the application stays up and running. \u201cAirlift Northwest has never had a custom application, nothing built for them from scratch. And they had not embraced the use of the cloud before this project,\u201d says Leeds. \u201cSo our team guided them through elevating their technology to be fully deployed in the cloud.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Airlift Northwest launched the Elevate app in late May after training. Carlton-Bishop says the company will begin measuring whether its response times are reduced after app implementation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">He is looking forward to working with more Capstone teams in years to come. To maintain and improve on the app, Team Elevate has set up an infrastructure that allows Capstone teams working with the nonprofit to add functionality going forward. \u201cOur goal was to set them up for the future,\u201d says Van der Meulen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">After months of all-consuming work \u2013 members say their families wonder why they don\u2019t return calls \u2013 the team is finally satisfied that they have met their goal: to use the knowledge learned at the iSchool \u00a0to make a lasting impact in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">\u201cWe know we are delivering something that will work for their users, because we\u2019ve kept them involved every step of the way,\u201d says Leeds. \u201cWe\u2019ve really considered what it is like to live and work in their shoes.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n&nbsp;"},{"title":"Meal Matchup","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/meal-matchup\/","tags":["alumni","engineering","faculty"],"pillars":["public-good","student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Human Centered Design &amp; Engineering students are reducing food waste and serving the community with a website that connects UW dining halls to local homeless shelters.","content":"<strong>(College of Engineering, August 2018)<\/strong>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIf you had a million dollars, what kind of tech project would you create for social good?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When this question was posed to Madison Holbrook, \u201918, in a human centered design and engineering (HCDE) class taught by lecturer Irini Spyridakis, she knew exactly what she\u2019d do: use technology to reduce hunger and food waste.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI was raised in a food-minded community in eastern Washington \u2014 my mother runs our family ranch, and my dad and brother manage a mobile catering service that provides food to emergency responders during disaster events,\u201d the former HCDE major and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.engr.washington.edu\/stars\"><span class=\"s2\">STARS student<\/span><\/a>\u00a0explains. \u201cThrough community and family I learned the importance of not wasting food.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Food waste contributes to several social problems, ranging from hunger and malnutrition to environmental and economic concerns.

Their project was awarded $21,000 to support the creation of a website to connect excess dining hall food with local non-profit agencies that could distribute it to people in need.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>From classroom to kitchens<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Over the past year, Holbrook and Spyridakis have led an interdisciplinary research group to develop the concept into a fully-functional web platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Their team \u2014 which has grown to include 33 students from HCDE, the Information School, and the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering \u2014 designed the interface for and with the help of three stakeholder groups: UW dining halls, local shelters and student volunteers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Their web platform,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mealmatchup.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\">mealmatchup.org<\/span><\/a>, works like this: Food providers log food donations and request pickups online. Food transporters then schedule drivers for pickup and deliveries. Since it\u2019s important to ensure that food donations\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.doh.wa.gov\/CommunityandEnvironment\/Food\/FoodWorkerandIndustry\/CharityFoodDonations\"><span class=\"s2\">meets required state guidelines<\/span><\/a>, the transporters are trained in food handling and safety and use the website to document proof-of-pickup and delivery, track food temperatures and navigate pickup and drop-off locations. Receiving agencies use the interface to understand what will be arriving, when, how much and who will be delivering it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To launch the project, team members invested time building relationships and deepening their understanding of stakeholder needs and concerns. On campus they worked closely with\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/hfs.uw.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">UW Housing &amp; Food Services<\/span><\/a>\u00a0administrators and dining hall managers. They also interviewed managers at more than 50 local homeless shelters, food banks and soup kitchens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Through that assessment, key priorities emerged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe learned that we needed to create a logistics-focused platform that was clear and easy-to-use so all parties could understand each other\u2019s needs and roles,\u201d Holbrook explains. \u201cSome campus dining halls already had donation systems in place, so rather than replace them we focused on how we could enhance them.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Timing, storage and transportation presented the biggest challenges for both the providers and receivers.\u201cDining halls can\u2019t necessarily send their staff to deliver food, and shelters can\u2019t always rely on volunteers to regularly pick up food,\u201d Holbrook says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For help with food transportation, Holbrook and Spyridakis reached out to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/carlson\/\"><span class=\"s2\">UW Carlson Leadership &amp; Public Service Center<\/span><\/a>\u00a0staff and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/students.washington.edu\/ecoreps\/greengreek\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Green Greeks<\/span><\/a>, a student group committed to sustainability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThrough Green Greeks and the Carlson Center\u2019s Service Learning program \u2014 in which students can earn course credit for participating in service activities \u2014 students agreed to organize and deliver food to area shelters from campus,\u201d says Spyridakis. \u201cThis arrangement has given the project a much-needed framework for managing and communicating transportation and has introduced our team to some wonderful new partners.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Piloting and next steps<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The team piloted Meal Matchup in May 2018 with UW dining halls Local Point, The 8 and District Market and shelters Union Gospel Mission and Compass Housing Alliance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat experience was so valuable,\u201d Holbrook says. \u201cWe accomplished all of the goals we set for the pilot and successfully problem-solved a few unexpected hurdles, such as how to adapt when a partner organization experiences management or staff turnover.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Team members are continuing their outreach efforts and have recently presented their work at international conferences.

Not the artists, who died centuries ago, but their master prints.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a conservator who specializes in works on paper, Kenny works with the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/henryart.org\/\"><span class=\"s3\">Henry Art Gallery<\/span><\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.lib.washington.edu\/\"><span class=\"s3\">University Libraries<\/span><\/a>\u00a0to conserve their significant collections of photographs and works on paper, including works by European masters. Her position is funded through a four-year grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For the Libraries, Kenny is currently focusing on regional photographs and works on paper, including photographs by the Seattle Camera Club and drawings by Eddie Sato, as well as rare Chinese stele rubbings. For the Henry, her focus is a collection of modern American photographs and two collections of European prints gifted to the museum: the Stimson-Bullitt Collection of nineteenth-century prints and the Albert Feldmann collection of fifteenth- to eighteenth-century master prints. Kenny met Feldmann, a former Boeing engineer fascinated by printmaking, before he passed away in May.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt was Mr. Feldmann\u2019s wish that these prints would inspire our community, and it is a privilege to be entrusted with their care and to help facilitate that vision,\u201d Kenny says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Though she divides her time between the Henry and the Libraries, Kenny does most of her conservation work at the recently completed Conservation Center in Suzzallo Library, which has a \u201cwet lab\u201d equipped with a large sink, a water filtration system, a humidification dome, a fume hood, and a microscope. It resembles a chemistry lab, and for good reason: chemistry is an important part of conservation work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cConservators do lots of testing of materials,\u201d says Kenny. \u201cFor a work on paper, we test the paper, the ink, and all the things that will eventually come into contact with it during treatment and storage, such as a mat board. Testing, analyzing, and studying the object to develop a treatment plan probably takes twice as much time as the actual treatment.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Kenny had no chemistry background when she became interested in conservation work. She had studied art and art history in college, and worked as a museum assistant after graduating. It was a paper conservator on that museum\u2019s staff who introduced her to art conservation. Kenny was so intrigued that she signed up for the chemistry courses and internships required for graduate study in the field, and then completed a master\u2019s in the conservation of fine art with a concentration in works on paper. \u201cI had done a fair amount of printmaking and\u00a0papermaking,\u201d Kenny says, \u201cso something about paper really spoke to me.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Kenny explains that the materials and technology involved in Western papermaking have changed over time, affecting the way a paper ages and influencing her treatment decisions. She offers the example of two prints from the Henry\u2019s collection, one from the fifteenth century, the other from the nineteenth century. Despite being hundreds of years older, the fifteenth-century print is in better condition because the paper was made with cotton rags, while the nineteenth-century print was made using less stable wood pulp that can degrade and discolor over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To reduce that discoloration, Kenny might choose to place artworks in a water bath. \u201cWhen you bathe an object, discoloration and acidity can be mitigated,\u201d she says. \u201cIt simultaneously re-establishes hydrogen bonds between the fibers, helping to extend the life of the paper.\u201d Of course the composition of a print\u2019s ink, and its sensitivity to moisture, must also be considered. \u201cThe relationship between paper and water is fundamental,\u201d says Kenny. \u201cA lot of what I do is thinking carefully about how to introduce moisture into objects, and then how to remove the moisture.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Though moisture is critical to treating works on paper, it also causes many of the problems that conservators encounter. Collectors beware: storing artworks in damp spaces can cause damage and accelerate deterioration. Direct sunlight can also be damaging. But what makes Kenny shudder the most is seeing tape used to repair or attach artworks to their mats. It\u2019s such a problem that whole art conservation workshops have been devoted to tape removal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cAs tape ages, the components of the adhesive break down and can stain the object, sometimes irreparably,\u201d says Kenny. \u201cThey can make the paper brittle and cause all kinds of damage. Removing tape is a complicated process that requires a lot of patience and chemistry. Do\u00a0<i>not<\/i>\u00a0use tape on things you want to keep!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Kenny is happy to share her expertise with the campus community, particularly with iSchool and Museology Program students. She plans to meet with high school students as part of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/henryart.org\/programs\/henry-teen-collective\"><span class=\"s3\">Henry Teen Collective<\/span><\/a>\u00a0program, and has been a resource for UW archaeology students, testing paper scraps they unearthed during an excavation. But mostly she relishes working with the Henry and Libraries collections, especially the problem-solving required.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI rely on my knowledge of art history, chemistry, and making art, as well as conversations with curators, which help me understand the context within which objects were made,\u201d Kenny says. \u201cEach project is unique and the solution is different, but over time I\u2019ve gotten better at diagnosing things quickly and building on my previous experience and understanding.\u201d \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Asked if there\u2019s enough work to keep her busy for the next few years, Kenny laughs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe collections are vast,\u201d she says. \u201cI could keep working with them for a very long time.\u201d<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Fighting dementia with data","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/fighting-dementia-with-data\/","tags":["alumni","continuum-college","pce"],"pillars":["public-good","impact","student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Porsche Everson was looking to improve her career trajectory by earning a Certificate in Data Visualization.

What she learned gave her a fresh outlook on her work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe\u2019re looking at an entirely new way to see relationships in data,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most amazing thing in the world to be able to look at the data surrounding an issue and truly understand, in a moment, the core conversations that need to happen around that subject.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">VISUALIZING WAYS TO COMBAT DEMENTIA<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One of the main things that Porsche wants people to know about dementia and cognitive decline is that something can be done about them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat feeling of worry and almost hopelessness about dementia \u2014 it doesn't have to be as strong as it is sometimes,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a number of risk factors for dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s that are potentially modifiable.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To get this message out in a creative, interactive way, Porsche turned to what she\u2019d learned in the data visualization certificate program. First she applied dementia\u2019s nine modifiable risk factors\u00a0 \u2014 including depression, obesity, blood pressure and other conditions \u2014 to the findings of a major study on aging and brain health. Then she used Tableau to create a visualization that allows you\u00a0to manipulate different data points and see how these factors interact with each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For example, someone who is overweight and has high blood pressure can use the visualization to see how addressing these health problems potentially reduces their risk of developing dementia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI designed it for researchers, so that they could examine a large data set of information about brain health in a significant population,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what I discovered is that regular folks who are concerned about their health are pretty interested in this visualization too.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">HAVING AN IMPACT<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Porsche\u2019s work received special recognition when Tableau chose her as one of 10 featured authors on their website, highlighting the dementia visualization as a top project. The recognition \u2014 and her new data skills \u2014 have delivered a valuable career boost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe UW data visualization\u00a0program was the best thing I\u2019ve ever done for professional development,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a really great way to enhance this part of my career \u2014 I would recommend it highly to anyone.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But Porsche\u2019s greatest satisfaction is the feeling that her work today can help people who may be afraid\u00a0of developing dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s at some point down the road.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cOne of the most powerful things we can do,\u201d she said, \u201cis change fear into hope.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Visit the Tableau website to see Porsche\u2019s\u00a0<\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/public.tableau.com\/profile\/porsche.everson#!\/vizhome\/ACTStudyDementiaRiskFactors\/LancetRiskFactors\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>featured visualization<\/i><\/span><\/a><i>\u00a0and\u00a0<\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/public.tableau.com\/profile\/porsche.everson#!\/\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>more of her work<\/i><\/span><\/a><i>.\u00a0<\/i><\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Changing the lives of older adults","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/changing-the-lives-of-older-adults\/","tags":["alumni","continuum-college","pce"],"pillars":["public-good","student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Jennifer Jones has twice been able to make a career transformation through a UW certificate program. Now she\u2019s using what she learned in both programs to make a difference in the lives of the elderly.","content":"(Continuum College, May 2018)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Nearly a decade ago, as the U.S. economy went into a tailspin, Jennifer Jones decided to shake up her career.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She\u2019d worked for many years as a photojournalist, and had also operated an import clothing business with her husband. But the Great Recession gave her the opportunity to make a change \u2014 and at the age of 50, she was ready for a new challenge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI knew that I wanted to go into a different field and take a different path, but I didn't quite know how to do that,\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cI didn't really want to have to pursue another four-year degree.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That\u2019s when she discovered the certificate programs offered by the University of Washington, programs that would ultimately change her life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">LEARNING TO TELL VISUAL STORIES<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Jennifer already understood the vital role that images play in telling complex stories. And she also realized that, as she noted, \u201cin today\u2019s media, video is everything.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In order to move from taking photos to making movies, Jennifer decided to enroll in the UW certificate program in independent filmmaking, now known as the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pce.uw.edu\/certificates\/film-and-video-production\"><span class=\"s2\">Certificate in Film &amp; Video Production<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe program\u2019s instructors were professionals who actually worked in the field, Emmy Award winners,\u201d she said. \u201cWe learned extremely technical video editing tools. It was the real deal.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She completed a short documentary film during the program about flooding in a small town in northern Washington, and later made two other documentaries on environmental subjects. But something still wasn\u2019t quite right with her career.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">FINDING HER TRUE CALLING<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Another turning point in Jennifer\u2019s life came when she began caring for her widowed mother, who was struggling with grief and depression. In the process, Jennifer found herself drawn to a new field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cHelping my mom introduced me to the challenges of aging adults, and the support that they need,\u201d she noted. \u201cI became very curious about that as a career path. I knew a woman who was a geriatric care manager, and she invited me to help her. I began working with elders one on one.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But she felt like she didn\u2019t have the essential, baseline knowledge she needed to make a full transition to this new profession. So she began exploring her options for further education.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI really wanted to know more \u2014 I wanted an academic background in this,\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cI needed to understand the processes of aging and get a much more comprehensive knowledge base.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">EDUCATION THAT OPENS DOORS<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So Jennifer turned again to the UW, this time enrolling in the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pce.uw.edu\/certificates\/gerontology\"><span class=\"s2\">Certificate in Gerontology<\/span><\/a>\u00a0program. Once more, the experience paid big dividends in both information and inspiration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe studied the biology, psychology and sociology of aging, as well as the current issues related to aging,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt was wonderful, comprehensive knowledge, and I think it gave me so much more confidence that I had the skills to be able to help people. At the age of 55, I was able to go back to school and learn new things, and that was powerful.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Earning the certificate also helped her understand what good care can do for older adults, a population that is growing at an exponential rate today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe gerontology program opened up a vision of the future for me,\u201d she noted. \u201cI could see that this is what healthy aging can look like. It was a revelation, and it\u2019s opened so many doors.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Jennifer eventually launched her own business, Conscious Aging Eldercare, and now makes her living working with many different clients on their physical and cognitive issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI have eight different clients right now,\u201d she explained. \u201cI visit them once a week and I do different things for them \u2014 take them on outings and help them with projects and other organizational things. Using the tools that I gained from the program has allowed me to do this incredibly rewarding work.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">COMBINING HER PASSIONS<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">About five years ago, Jennifer found a great way to meld her gerontology and filmmaking backgrounds. That\u2019s when she joined a workshop led Trudy James, a former hospital chaplain who has dedicated her life to issues surrounding death and dying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After completing the class, Jennifer mentioned that she was also a filmmaker. Trudy said she\u2019d been thinking about making a documentary about the workshops and the overall topic. A partnership was born.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI spent two years working with Trudy to create the film\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/speakingofdying.com\/\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>Speaking of Dying<\/i><\/span><\/a>,\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a short, educational movie that helps people engage with the idea of planning for a good life ending.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The film has since been shown over 500 times to audiences around the country, generating demand for the workshops and sparking countless meaningful conversations among families about end-of-life plans and desires.\u00a0Jennifer has even become a trained workshop facilitator herself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ultimately, completing the two UW certificate programs gave Jennifer the confidence and ability to remake her professional life \u2014 and to make a difference in the lives of others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI feel so fortunate that these programs were available. It changed everything for me,\u201d she concluded. \u201cThe other day, a client who was grappling with the recent loss of her husband looked at me and said, \u2018Thank you, Jennifer. You\u2019ve given me courage.\u2019 There\u2019s nothing better than that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"The power of an image","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/the-power-of-an-image\/","tags":["alumni","continuum-college","pce"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Purnima Bhaskaran wanted to take a deeper look at life, and the Certificate in Photography gave her the opportunity to see the world \u2014 and her career\u2014 in a new way.<\/span><\/p>","content":"(Continuum College, August 2018)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Opening night was fast approaching, and set designer Purnima Bhaskaran was working hard to get ready. But she found herself getting distracted from her main duties.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\"I realized I like the imagery aspect of it. I liked what frames I was seeing,\u201d she said. \u201cMaking the posters were my favorite part ever. There was a huge play that we were putting on, but I loved making the poster better.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Purnima had moved to Seattle to take a job as an architect. Set design was just a side gig, a way to nurture her creativity. But as her interest in visual design grew, she decided to make some life changes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One was to pursue a new career as a UX designer, working on web sites and mobile apps in the technology field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI realized that visuals were my thing,\u201d Purnima said. \u201cSo I transitioned from architecture into UX design because I liked the nitty-gritty of all things tech. That is one space where you can \u2018build the building\u2019 but still go back and fix it. In architecture, you don\u2019t have the luxury to do so.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Purnima's other change was to look for a way to further explore the power of imagery. That\u2019s when she heard about the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pce.uw.edu\/certificates\/photography\"><span class=\"s2\">Certificate in Photography<\/span><\/a>\u00a0program at the University of Washington.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So she signed up, and a whole new world came into focus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">SEEING THE BIGGER PICTURE<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Despite having a design background and a pretty nice camera, Purnima was a newbie when it came to photography.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">\u201cI used to look at other photographs, other images, and go to galleries, but never understood the process behind it,\u201d she said. \u201cI never knew what I was doing wrong, never understood what I could do better.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Purnima checked out a variety of online photography courses, but something was still missing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">\"I've gone online and explored ideas, how to light things, how to get down to the right exposures and create this effect in my photograph,\" she said. \"But what I wasn't learning was the big picture \u2014 how that meaning or that idea would translate to another person, which in the end makes or breaks the message that you're putting out into the world creatively.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">In the UW program, Purnima found an important difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">\u201cIt was so much fun to meet a group of collaborative people who are all focused on making better images, and from different walks of life, different experiences,\u201d she said. \u201cBut to actually have people look at and critique your images is that point of inflection, that human contact that really helps knowledge, growth and understanding.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">DEVELOPING PROFESSIONALLY<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">This growth and increased knowledge has directly influenced Purnima's work as a UX designer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">\u201cYou start being more empathetic towards people, because you understand what experiences they're incorporating or analyzing your photo with,\u201d she said. \u201cIt changes the way you design, and it has made me a better designer.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Purnima recently transitioned to a new job, a move that she attributes to the greater sense of confidence she gained from the certificate program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">\u201cI've learned to market myself in a better way to stand out from the crowd,\u201d Purnima said. \u201cI believe speaking about my ideas and thoughts in relation to photography in such an inclusive and diverse environment helped me grow in confidence, and that was the key turning point for my growth at work too.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">LOOKING DEEPER<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">In addition to accelerating her career trajectory, Purnima discovered something unexpected during her time in the photography program: herself.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">In the final quarter, Purnima and her classmates were tasked with creating self-portraits. The project forced her to think about who she was, both as an artist and a person.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">\"Who is 'I' at the end of the day? What was I putting into that image?\" she said. \"And the image that I came up with, and finally put onto the wall for my colleagues and instructors and everybody else to critique, was a piece of myself.\"\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">It's this new self-knowledge that will remain for Purnima, enriching the rest of her life and how she lives it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">\"When you stop planning and start living in the moment\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and doing the best you can possibly do in that moment, even in terms of creating a photograph, in terms of creating a design, or just living life in general \u2014 it starts creating such a difference in your outlook,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause you've done the best you can for that one day.

A floating village, that is. Drawing on the expertise of researchers from six different UW departments, an interdisciplinary team of researchers is working to improve the health and living conditions of an impoverished floating community in the Peruvian Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe residents have chronic health issues and diseases and we know their bodies are being attacked,\u201d said CEE assistant professor\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ce.washington.edu\/people\/faculty\/neumannr\"><span class=\"s2\">Rebecca Neumann<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">From cleaning contaminated water to improving food security, the researchers are implementing innovative interventions to enhance both the built and natural environments in the village, called Claverito. They will measure their success based on the \u201cbefore and after\u201d health of village members and hope to ultimately share what they learn with other struggling communities.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe will use our experience to develop a replicable implementation model and strategy that could be applied to other insecure housing communities in the future,\u201d said professor\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/globalhealth.washington.edu\/faculty\/joseph-zunt\"><span class=\"s2\">Joseph Zunt<\/span><\/a>, a neurologist and professor in the departments of neurology and global health, who is one of the project visionaries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>A vulnerable village\u00a0<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The 50 houses in Claverito float for about six months each year before resting on dry ground again. Home to about 280 residents, the village is located on the banks of Iquitos, the capital of the Peruvian Amazon. A densely populated city, Iquitos\u2019 lack of space is so severe that people live in makeshift houses on the water, forming small informal settlements such as Claverito.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThey don\u2019t have anywhere to live, so they build these floating communities which are not recognized by the government,\u201d Neumann said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Not being recognized by the government means that the community does not receive water and sewer services, which compromises the health of community members. The majority of Claverito residents are indigenous people who work in jobs such as fishing, floodplain agriculture and selling goods in the markets and streets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">To understand the needs and desires of the community, and build trust, two lead researchers began visiting the community in 2015. Co-lead and UW alumnus Jorge \u201cCoco\u201d Alarc\u00f3n, who received an MLA in landscape architecture with a certificate in Global Health, resides in Iquitos where he oversees local project details on a day-to-day basis. The second co-lead is UW Built Environment Ph.D. candidate Leann Andrews, who lived in Iquitos for a year in order to visit the community daily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe community is a dream to work with,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cWe recognize that we're helping to provide services in their community to improve their health, but we are also benefiting from their gift of knowledge and data.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Cleaning contaminated water<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The water surrounding Claverito contains high levels of E. coli. In addition to outhouses draining directly into the water, a larger upstream community also causes additional water contamination. Although the majority of the community does not drink directly from the river, they use it for swimming and washing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou see the kids swimming in the polluted water and you know that if you were swimming in the water, you\u2019d be very sick,\u201d said Neumann,\u00a0who is leading the environmental research component of the interdisciplinary project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">To reduce water contamination, Neumann is investigating the use of aquatic vegetation, particularly native water hyacinths, to remove E. coli from the water. To test the feasibility of this solution, Neumann set up a floating experimental plot in February 2018, building off preliminary research by Andrews. Field tests will evaluate how water hyacinths are currently removing E. coli from the water, such as by absorbing it onto the surface of their roots or by creating a protected environment that attracts aquatic animals like zooplankton that eat E. coli.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIf we find that these plants successfully remove E. coli, we could harness that in a built intervention,\u201d Neumann said. \u201cFor example, we could create a space where people could interact with the water, such as a swimming area for the kids.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Before departing Claverito, Neumann trained a local researcher to continue taking ongoing measurements until the water recedes and houses once again settle on dry ground.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Floating gardens and walkways<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Getting to and from the houses in Claverito can be difficult. A steep hill leads down to the community and accessing houses entails walking along narrow wooden planks. To improve the built environment and reduce injuries, such as those resulting from falls, the researchers constructed stairs down the steep hill. A walkway is currently under construction, which will span the bottom of the hill and allow equal access to the entire village.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The researchers are also working to increase food security through built environment enhancements. Last year, 26 household floating gardens were added, which grow 36 different species of plants, both medicinal and edible varieties. The gardens boast regional specialties such as the local pepper aji charapita, regional tomato sacha tomate and regional cilantro sacha cilantro. This year, 30 households selected two gardening elements for their homes, ranging from a green wall on the side of their house to potted plants on their porch or in window boxes. A hillside community garden also grows medicinal plants to help cure diarrhea and parasites.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThese projects were seen to improve food insecurity, mental wellbeing, reduction of injuries, and social wellbeing as well as improved access to food and medicinal plants,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cBut the community still has a long way to go in terms of their health.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Interdisciplinary insight<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The interdisciplinary project benefits from the expertise of many, with team members from six different disciplines. The team includes dentists, physicians, nurses, landscape architects, an environmental engineer, microbiome experts and an epidemiologist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt is a highly interdisciplinary group, which is relatively rare,\u201d Neumann said. \u201cIt\u2019s been interesting, fun and informative to work with people who are trained in all these different ways and approaches.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">One example of how the researchers worked together to better understand the community was when the dental group noticed unexpected wearing of village members\u2019 teeth. Thinking it may be caused by metal exposure, they consulted with Neumann who tested the water and discovered that the metal content was low, but the water was acidic.

Weekday or weekend, there\u2019s plenty of work to be done, and everyone is expected to help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Justinn Lahaye grew up here. It\u2019s where she learned to ride horses and rope calves. But today, she\u2019s more of a visitor. Because today, she\u2019s a busy and ambitious third-year student at the UW School of Medicine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cMy parents work hard, and it\u2019s motivated me to do the same in every aspect of my life,\u201d says Lahaye.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">LIFE-OR-DEATH STRUGGLES<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Ranch life is unabashedly tough and unpredictable. Before Lahaye was born, the ranch flooded; this past year, there was a drought. The work is constant, and the animals get sick. Some days, it\u2019s a life-or-death struggle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Unfortunately, life-or-death matters have been a constant presence in Lahaye\u2019s life. Her father, Dale Marshall, has been sick as long as she can remember. She was 2 when he was diagnosed with leukemia, and even though a bone marrow transplant cured the cancer, that wasn\u2019t the end of his medical troubles. He had a heart attack when Lahaye was in high school. A sextuple coronary bypass surgery followed, and, a few years later, kidney failure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Throughout her father\u2019s health issues and the challenges of ranching life, working with horses was a comfort to Lahaye. \u201cI grew up with them, almost like siblings,\u201d she says. From junior high school on, Lahaye participated in rodeo, eventually making national finals and putting herself through college with scholarships.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Lahaye says ranch life and rodeo taught her discipline, teamwork and the value of persistence. \u201cHard work can get you a lot of places,\u201d she says.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">FROM MONTANA TO MEDICAL SCHOOL<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Lahaye was always interested in a career in medicine; her mother suspects that it was all those hours she spent with her dad at medical appointments. She was in college when she realized she truly wanted to become a doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">There were hurdles to overcome. For one, there was the question of money. Rodeo and academic scholarships had gotten Lahaye through college, but now she would have to take out student loans. Fortunately, she also received scholarship funds from the Friends of the UW School of Medicine, which eased the financial burden somewhat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Her father was also a consideration. Despite her dad\u2019s worsening health, Lahaye\u2019s parents supported her decision to apply to medical school. When he was hospitalized with kidney failure, she had to leave his bedside to attend her medical-school entrance interview in Bozeman, hundreds of miles away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt was really hard, knowing that my dad\u2019s health was poor and I wasn\u2019t able to come home and help as much as I used to,\u201d she says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Lahaye worried about the future of the family ranch, too. It had always been assumed that she would take over from her parents one day, but medical school \u2014 and a career as a doctor \u2014 could take her far away from home. Together, the family rallied to find solutions, and Lahaye\u2019s oldest sister and her husband agreed to move home to help their parents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Now, their three children are growing up on the ranch, learning to ride and work the cattle, and Lahaye teaches them riding and roping skills when she visits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m trying to pass on as much knowledge as I can about ranching and rodeo, because they are the next generation, and hopefully, one day, they\u2019ll take over the ranch,\u201d she says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">THE CHALLENGE OF RURAL MEDICINE<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">For Lahaye, who grew up inspired by the family doctor\u2019s connection to rural communities, the UW School of Medicine\u2019s WWAMI program was a perfect fit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This five-state medical education program emphasizes educating students from the region \u2014 Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho \u2014 for the region. Founded in 1971, the program is a response, in part, to the growing need for doctors in rural and other underserved areas. Students are exposed to medical care in all sorts of situations: from the tiniest clinic in rural Alaska to large urban hospitals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Following 18 months of classroom work, students like Lahaye start rotating through various sites, learning about different medical disciplines, meeting patients and getting to know the community. Lahaye has been on rotations since early 2017. She also took part in the WRITE (WWAMI Rural Integrated Training Experience) program, which offers additional training in a rural setting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">One of Lahaye\u2019s rotations took place at Frances Mahon Deaconess Hospital in Glasgow, Montana \u2014 the same place where she was born. Under the guidance of her preceptors, she helped treat patients while learning about family medicine, internal medicine, OB-GYN, psychiatry and pediatrics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cJustinn has a good rapport with patients; people like to talk to her,\u201d says Anne Millard, M.D., one of her preceptors. \u201cThey will tell her things that they might not tell somebody else \u2014 including me.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Millard is all too aware of the physician shortage in rural areas like hers. \u201cOur biggest issue is keeping doctors,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019ll come out here for a couple of years, and then they leave. It\u2019s not a lifestyle everybody wants.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Moving a family here can be difficult, as career opportunities for spouses \u2014 outside agriculture \u2014 are limited. And with fewer specialists in rural areas, doctors sometimes feel overwhelmed at the wide range of medical issues they manage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">But, Millard adds, there are compensations. \u201cThis is a very tight community, as most rural communities are. People help each other and take care of each other.\u201d She hopes that, after Lahaye graduates from medical school and completes her residency, she\u2019ll come back to work at the clinic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">\u201cThe fact that she\u2019s willing to come back to a rural area and do this kind of medicine is just wonderful,\u201d says Millard.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">RURAL LIVING, RURAL DOCTORS<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Although medical school doesn\u2019t leave much time for riding, Lahaye stays connected by cheering on her husband, Kody, a professional rodeo competitor who coaches rodeo at Montana State University. And, after graduation, she\u2019s looking forward to settling down permanently in a community like the one she grew up in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ve learned how important rural physicians are to these communities. People like my dad struggle with access to healthcare in rural Montana, and the growing physician shortage means it\u2019s going to be harder to get the medical care you need,\u201d she says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI want to be able to give back to those small communities,\u201d says Lahaye. \u201cI can help people like my parents and our neighbors continue to live the rural way of life.\u201d<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Fostering brotherhood abroad","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/fostering-brotherhood-abroad\/","tags":["arts-sciences","giving","graduate-student","public-health","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Study abroad can be life-changing, but it can also seem largely inaccessible to young men of color.

To help address this disparity, Joe Lott, associate professor at the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">College of Education<\/span><\/a>, established the BI in 2016 as part of President Obama\u2019s My Brother\u2019s Keeper Community Challenge \u2014 and in line with the UW\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/raceequity\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Race and Equity Initiative<\/span><\/a>, launched by President Ana Mari Cauce.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe main barrier for many of these students of color is a sense of belonging at the institution, because they rarely see other students, faculty and staff who look like them,\u201d says Lott. \u201cWe wanted to create a space where they feel welcome and at home.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">That sense of belonging has been especially lacking in study abroad programs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cStudents don\u2019t see themselves in study abroad materials, and they think, \u2018Well, that\u2019s not for me,\u2019\u201d says Tory Brundage, a graduate student at the College of Education and member of the BI leadership team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Another major hurdle is the cost, he says. Many BI students come from lower-income backgrounds, so time away from a job or the burden of additional loan debt to cover trip expenses puts study abroad out of reach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In late 2016, Lott and Brundage began exploring how to make study abroad possible for BI students. And last summer, thanks to financial support from\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/studyabroad\/\"><span class=\"s2\">UW Study Abroad<\/span><\/a>, four BI students headed overseas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Marquis\u2019 journey<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">BI member Marquis Wright never thought he\u2019d be able to study abroad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">A junior majoring in communication and creative writing, Wright grew up south of Seattle in Federal Way. During his freshman year, he was typically the only person of color in the room, and he often felt as if he didn\u2019t belong. But thanks to the BI, Wright found the support he needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe Brotherhood Initiative made my being a man of color on campus \u2014 and in academia in general \u2014 more manageable,\u201d he says. \u201cIt really opened up the doors for everything I\u2019ve done at the UW. I know that no matter what I do, I have a network of peers and mentors behind me.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Still, studying abroad never seemed feasible, Wright says, between the high cost and the demands of his majors. \u201cThen, through the Brotherhood Initiative,\u201d he says, \u201cI heard about the Dark Empire program in London.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Led by Clarence Spigner from the School of Public Health, Dark Empire is an exploration seminar on race, health and society in the U.K. Thanks to the donor-supported\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/global\/opportunities\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Global Opportunities Fund<\/span><\/a>, Wright and two other BI members received scholarships to take part in the program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">While Wright loved experiencing U.K. culture, some of his most valuable lessons came from reflecting on life back home as a black man in a predominantly white city.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIn Seattle, it\u2019s easy to feel like an outsider,\u201d says Wright.

Through this experience, she discovered her desire to work toward achieving educational equity for students of all backgrounds.\n\nAs she started to increase the number of hours she spent at her sister\u2019s school, Aguilar noticed that Spanish-speaking parents were approaching her to learn about how their children were progressing at school. At first, she was perplexed by their inquiries.\n\n\u201cWhy were they asking me about their kids instead of the teacher?\u201d Aguilar wondered. \u201cI realized that I was the mediator who spoke both English and Spanish. It didn\u2019t seem like a big deal at first, but it became the reason why I felt like I should be in education.\u201d\n\nAs a child of Mexican immigrants who only speak Spanish, Aguilar had grown accustomed to acting as a mediator. Through her time in her sister\u2019s classroom, Aguilar realized that her personal experiences enabled her to support Spanish-speaking parents in a unique way.\n\nAfter graduating from community college, Aguilar started looking into education programs that would prepare her to support students and parents from diverse backgrounds. When her mentors in California mentioned the University of Washington, Aguilar felt that the flexibility and values of the UW College of Education\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/programs\/undergraduate\/ecfs\">Early Childhood and Family Studies<\/a> (ECFS) program were complementary to her academic interests.\n\nNow a senior, Aguilar said a research project in senior lecturer Carrie Brennan\u2019s course on social policy, children and families helped set the course of her studies. For the project, Aguilar decided to analyze the allocation of funds in California school districts. After getting into the research, she was shocked by her findings.\n\n\u201cThe schools were receiving funding to help low-income children succeed in their standardized testing but instead it was being used to buy printers or office supplies. It made my blood boil. That\u2019s the way California schools were when I was a kid\u2014so why haven\u2019t things improved?\u201d\n\nThe project opened Aguilar\u2019s eyes to opportunities to research and address issues of educational inequity on a macro scale, and next fall, she\u2019ll continue her studies in the UW\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.educationpolicy.uw.edu\/\">master in education policy<\/a> program.\n\nIn addition to her desire to initiate change in education on a policy level, Aguilar hopes to inspire first-generation college students like herself to achieve more than they ever thought possible.\n\n\u201cI want students to know that there is a voice for them, that there are people out there fighting for them who are just like them. Those are people who found their purpose and were able to succeed, despite challenges like parental language barriers.\u201d\n\nAguilar plans to focus her future policy work on the K-8 sector, noting that elementary school is a crucial period for the academic development of children, which makes it a logical intervention point for policy-level change. Ultimately, she hopes to instigate systems-level changes in education policy not only locally, but also nationally and globally.\n\n\u201cThere are so many other countries that are doing more in education,\u201d Aguilar said. \u201cI want to study them and see how we can model their approaches and use them for the benefit of our children, regardless of race or income level. In the end, I want to find hope for our children and to continue to develop their love of learning.\u201d"},{"title":"Positioning students as knowledge builders","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/positioning-students-as-knowledge-builders\/","tags":["college-of-education","graduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"As a high school student in South Korea, University of Washington College of Education PhD student Soo-Yean Shim was already imagining alternative approaches to make science classes engaging for all students.","content":"(College of Education, May 2018)\n\nAs a high school student in South Korea, University of Washington College of Education PhD student Soo-Yean Shim was already imagining alternative approaches to make science classes engaging for all students.\n\nHer inspiration came during a transformative experience in which she joined a genetics research team at a local university. In helping the team collect data, Shim found herself making sense of the world using resources and experimental data that she had gathered herself.\n\nShe embraced taking an active role in her education\u2014something missing from her prior experiences with science education, which largely consisted of memorizing and repeating facts presented by a teacher.\n\nHer experience with research led Shim to enroll in a teacher education course in South Korea. It was there that she was first introduced to the inquiry-based model of learning as a theoretical framework, and during an internship in Washington D.C., Shim saw how the theory could function in a live classroom.\n\n\u201cThe way that the students were learning science was quite different from the experiences I had in my educational journey as a student,\u201d Shim said.\n\nWhile her own experience had been following scripted experiments, the students she observed \u201cwere engaging in various investigations to make sense of the world in their own ways.\u201d\n\nHelping students transition from information receivers into knowledge builders is a core value of the inquiry-based model of learning. Within this framework, Shim said, teachers become facilitators of the knowledge building process rather than sole providers of scientific knowledge.\n\nFollowing her internship, Shim returned to South Korea to earn her master\u2019s in science education. While reading articles on science education research, she discovered the work of Jessica Thompson, Mark Windschitl, and Jennifer Richards at the UW College of Education. Intrigued by their studies on model-based scientific inquiry and teacher education, Shim was inspired to apply to the College\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/programs\/graduate\/curriculum-and-instruction\/\">curriculum and instruction program<\/a> with a focus on science education.\n\n\u201cThere were two things that fascinated me about their work: the application of model-based inquiry and emphasis on collaboration among teachers,\u201d Shim said. \u201cThey valued what students brought to the table and how teachers could improve their practices through collaboration. That\u2019s what made me want to come to UW.\u201d\n\nDuring the first three years of her PhD program, Shim worked with Thompson and Richards on their research in the Highline and Seattle school districts, focusing on <a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/news\/all-it-together\">growing collaboration among teachers<\/a> to position their students as knowledge builders in their classrooms.\n\nThis year, Shim is continuing her work at a high school in the Highline district for her dissertation research, examining the ways that science teachers\u2019 collaborative efforts to improve their teaching in a professional learning community can contribute to providing rich opportunities for diverse students to learn science in meaningful ways.\n\n\u201cWhen we start to view students not as \u2018your students\u2019 or \u2018my students\u2019 but as our students, that is where we can start to truly collaborate and transform student learning,\u201d Shim said.\n\nIn the future, Shim plans to continue contributing to science education research by positioning students as active knowledge builders while promoting collaboration among teachers.\n\n\u201cI hope for students to be positioned as knowledge builders so that they can bring in their own perspectives and ways of making sense of the natural world into science classrooms,\u201d she said. \u201cIn collaborations among students, teachers and across schools, I see the potential for making major improvements in science education for all students.\u201d"},{"title":"Taking on bias in special education","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/taking-on-bias-in-special-education\/","tags":["college-of-education","graduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"As a novice teacher in a Denver elementary school, Nathan Houston recalls his growing discomfort with how students were being referred to special educations services.","content":"(College of Education, February 2018)\n\nAs a novice teacher in a Denver elementary school, Nathan Hoston recalls his growing discomfort with how students were being referred to special education services.\n\n\u201cThe first year,\" Hoston said, \"the system seemed biased and subjective in a way that made me uncomfortable.\"\n\nHoston, who at the time was teaching kindergarten through second grade students with high-incidence disabilities, saw black boys disproportionately represented in special education services at his school and surrounding schools.\n\nAfter four years leading his school's special education department and Multi-Tiered Systems and Support (MTSS) team\u2014and seeing research confirm the disproportionality he saw on the ground\u2014Hoston is taking on the challenge as a doctoral student at the University of Washington College of Education.\n\nIt\u2019s an issue that\u2019s personal for Hoston, who received special education services as a child.\n\nHe still recalls the moment when he became aware of being different that his elementary school classmates.\n\n\u201cI remember one time that my sister ran up to me and said, \u2018Nathan! Mom told me that you were born with a tail and that you are in special ed\u2019,\u201d Hoston said.\n\n\u201cI told my mom what happened and she said, \u2018Actually, you weren\u2019t born with a tail, but you did receive services. Do you remember the times that you were pulled out of class for small group?\u2019 That\u2019s when I realized that those experiences I was having at school were special education.\u201d\n\nIn preschool, Hoston was identified as having a speech-language impediment. He was often pulled out of class to receive small-group instruction with other students who had more severe disabilities. By second grade, he had tested out of special education and stopped receiving services.\n\nWhile Hoston was accurately identified as being in need of special education services, research shows that this is not always the case. Historically, overrepresentation in special education has been detrimental for students of color, especially for black boys.\n\n\u201cOver-referrals of black boys to special education services highlights inherent bias that referring teachers have against black boys,\u201d Hoston said. \u201cI've heard of teachers who have referred black boys to services for being too loud or rowdy, which is simply racist and absurd. This historically and culturally ingrained bias is being perpetuated through referrals to services.\u201d\n\nHoston also notes that black boys who have been referred to special education services are more likely to receive unfair punitive procedures, and later on in life, black boys in special education tend to face worse post-secondary education outcomes than their peers. By receiving unnecessary special education services, he said, black boys continue to experience the negative impacts of a widening opportunity gap.\n\nBy the end of his second year as a teacher, Hoston was asking questions that led him to pursue further education. After finding the UW College of Education\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/programs\/graduate\/special-education\">special education program<\/a>, Hoston moved back to his home state of Washington to earn his doctorate.\n\nTaking on the issues he observed in Denver, Hoston intends to focus his research on streamlining MTSS interventions and reducing the number of African-American boys being referred to special education services.\n\nHoston noted that as a student moves through special education intervention cycles, the school\u2019s MTSS team should be discussing that student\u2019s progress. Yet due to a lack of clear guidelines, this process is frequently inefficient. Through his research, Hoston plans to improve MTSS meetings and standardize intervention approaches across schools.\n\n\u201cMTSS is a great idea and I think it can help in solving the disproportionality problem, if we do it right. So my research question is as follows: what do we need to change about MTSS to make it an effective system?\u201d\n\nIn the future, Hoston, a recipient of the College's <a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/alumni-and-friends\/make-gift\">Vivian Cady Johnson Endowed Memorial Scholarship<\/a>, hopes to continue working with school districts on their special education intervention processes by helping to create MTSS teams in schools. He is also interested in continuing to conduct research while working in a school district. Another option is going back into a school as a principal where he can engage with students personally.\n\n\u201cMy dream job would be to work with school districts on their process of intervention with MTSS and to create sustainable, effective teams for referring students to special education services. In addition, I hope that my work would impact how many black boys are being referred to special education services.\u201d"},{"title":"Connecting grandparents and grandchildren with special needs","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/connecting-grandparents-and-grandchildren-with-special-needs\/","tags":["college-of-education","graduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"A new study being conducted at the University of Washington's Haring Center for Research and Training in Inclusive Education is examining the relationships between children with special needs and their grandparents \u2014 and how to enhance those relations.

She found that the grandparents she interviewed had difficulty providing care for their grandchildren for various reasons, such as not knowing how best to provide support when their grandchild had unique learning needs and having a difficult time connecting.\n\nWith the rapid developments in intervention strategies, parents of children with special needs often struggle to stay current with changing best practices, even with support from school teams\u2014for grandparents, who have far less access to the professionals working with their grandchild, it can feel impossible to keep up with new developments in practice.\n\n\u201cGrandparents are a group of people in families with children with special needs that do not have access to the same kind of structures or programs as siblings or parents,\u201d Yang said. \u201cAnd if we can find a way to better include them to support their grandchildren, it can change family dynamics and take some of the stress away from the entire family.\u201d\n\nYang said to conduct her study, she will present children with special needs and their grandparents with a variety of photographs that will allow grandparents a chance to tell stories and share history with their grandchildren, but with targeted support to help facilitate these important interactions.\n\nOriginally from Singapore, Yang said she was surprised about the lack of support for grandparents of children with children with special needs in the United States. Coming from a country where the special education support is still in its infancy, she said seeing a deficiency in support for such an important group in families was glaring.\n\nIn addition to this study, Yang is participating in the development and facilitation of a grandparent workshop this spring with The Arc of King County that will help provide informational and emotional support, as well as share different perspectives with the aim of helping grandparents contribute to the wellbeing of all their grandchildren, regardless of their needs."},{"title":"A pathway to discovery","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/a-pathway-to-discovery\/","tags":["college-of-education","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"","content":"(College of Education, May 2018)\n\nA few weeks into her new job training teen volunteers at Pacific Science Center how to take up issues of equity and social justice in their work, Pilar Letrondo noticed something concerning mid-way through a session she was leading on identity.\n\n\"All the white kids sat on one side of the table and all of the non-white kids sat on the other,\" she said. \"[I] realized that I needed to address the seating situation.\u201d\n\nIt was a striking example of how physical spaces can impact teaching and learning, and even more so, the challenge of overcoming bias in educational spaces.\n\nFor Letrondo, it's been a valuable learning experience made possible through her senior capstone internship in the University of Washington's\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/programs\/undergraduate\/eco\">Education, Communities and Organizations<\/a>\u00a0major.\n\nAs part of Letrondo\u2019s ECO major requirements, she\u2019s required to complete an internship with an organization of her choice\u2014and got matched with Pacific Science Center, a place she enjoyed visiting as a child.\n\nNow an intern with the center\u2019s Discovery Corps team, Letrondo supports staff members who work with teen volunteers.\n\n\u201cI help with trainings and check-outs.

As a hands-on learner, she always felt more comfortable outdoors than in a classroom. This trait led her to become an outdoor educator, where she taught subjects such as recreation and backpacking to middle and high school students.\n\nAfter being assigned to work with third graders one summer, however, her perception of younger students began to change.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was doing, but I fell in love with their energy right away,\u201d Lebby said. \u201cThey are trying to grasp their concepts of values and feelings.\u201d\n\nThat experience of connecting with younger students inspired Lebby to merge the realms of outdoor and elementary education. A search for outdoor leadership programs led her to the University of Washington\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/curriculum-instruction\/islandwood-residency\">graduate residency program at IslandWood<\/a>, where she developed outdoor education plans for elementary school students before earning her teaching credentials through the College of Education's <a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/programs\/teacher\/elementary-tep\">elementary teacher preparation program<\/a>.\n\n\u201cThe biggest takeaway from IslandWood was my philosophy of education\u2014more specifically, how I see my students as whole children, not just learners in my classroom,\u201d she said. \u201cI learned to view my students as being more than empty vessels. Children are not just experiencing the world, but are instead using their past experiences to shape the world around them.\u201d\n\nLebby\u2019s experiences at IslandWood planted seeds that grew into her vision for teaching, and today in The Option Program at Seward (TOPS) K-8 School, her approach to education is anything but conventional.\n\nOriginally founded by parents in the community, TOPS is an option program with a focus on social justice that students across the Seattle public school district are able to access. Lebby approaches her teaching with an environmental lens.\n\n\u201cWe focus on colony class disorder in bees and what that means for our environment and our human role in the environment. We have a community garden where we plant things like kale, strawberries, garlic and chives. We recycle milk cartons and use those for our plant starts.\u201d\n\nLast year, Lebby was named the 2017 Grosvenor Teacher Fellow and invited to join an expedition to Alaska with National Geographic and Lindblad Expeditions that included ecologists, naturalists and educators. Lebby is now applying those experiences in her lessons on ecosystems and climate change.\n\nRecently, she used examples from Alaskan ecosystems to facilitate a lesson on species interactions. Lebby assigned each student a specific animal species to research and present to the class. On presentation day, the students sat in a circle and took turns presenting, passing around and adding to a ball of yarn with each turn. The yarn become a visual representation of how all species are interconnected, enabling the students to see the impact that eliminating one species would have on the ecosystem.\n\nBeyond science, Lebby is incorporating elements of her trip into every subject she teaches.\n\n\u201cWith social studies, we talk about whaling techniques and tribes in Southeast Alaska and compare them with the Salish people in the Puget Sound region. There is some environmental reading we will do when we get into non-fiction texts. We also have social and emotional curriculum called RULER where I will use my emotions from the trip as examples for the lessons.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Lebby wants her students to take with them a greater awareness of who they are and the impact they have on the world.\n\n\u201cI hope that my students will be able to see that we are all connected, not only to each other but also to the environment.

Meanwhile, caregivers could access the app to communicate directly with teachers and provide information about students\u2019 home lives.\n\n\"It was an inspiring evening to hear what the winning team has developed,\" said Ideathon judge Assunta Ng, publisher of Northwest Asian Weekly and the Seattle Chinese Post. \"The team understood the needs of the students, and attacked the problem directly with an innovative solution\u2014BRITE App. I was also impressed with the team\u2019s diversity, presentation and insightfulness.\"\n\nwww.youtube.com&lt;\/a&gt;, or enable JavaScript if it is disabled in your browser.&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n\nUW President Ana-Mari Cauce spoke about the significance of bringing an innovative mindset to the most pressing challenges in education during the opening of Ideathon.\n\n\u201cOften when people think about innovation, they think about gadgets,\u201d Cauce said, \u201cbut we need innovation in things like school, outreach, how do we design communities, absolutely as much as we do in science or technology.\u201d\n\nCauce also encouraged the design teams\u2014which included students majoring in <a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/programs\/undergraduate\/ecfs\">Early Childhood and Family Studies<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/programs\/undergraduate\/eco\">Education, Communities and Organizations<\/a>, as well as those minoring in <a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/programs\/undergraduate\/els\">Education, Learning and Society<\/a>\u2014to explore the connection between inclusion and innovation during their work.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s in the school or in the community, inclusive innovative is all about understanding that, if we\u2019re going to come up with solutions that actually work, you can\u2019t come in as the expert from above, you have to work with the community and draw from their expertise, because they\u2019re experts too,\u201d Cauce said.\n\nMembers of the College\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/campaign\/ambassadors\">Ambassador Board<\/a> provided funding for Ideathon.

He remembers students at the school being respectful and interested in speaking with him.\n\nJust an hour later, he traveled to a school serving poverty-impacted students on the south side of the city. In contrast to the first school, the visit was disorderly and the students largely ignored Garnett\u2019s presentation, talking amongst themselves.\n\n\u201cI remember getting back to my car and getting emotional,\u201d Garnett says. \u201cIt had nothing to do with what the kids had just done; it was what I had seen.\n\n\u201cThe kids from the well-resourced school understood the value of going to a school like Bowdoin. At the other school, Bowdoin meant nothing to them because there was no one that they knew\u2014no one in their network of friends, family or community\u2014who had ever gone to a place like that. So why should they care?\u201d\n\nGarnett, a first-generation college graduate himself, was forced to drop out after his first year due to financial challenges and spent the next eight years completing his degree while working part-time retail jobs, often with full-time hours. Even before college, his path was unconventional, born and raised in the U.S. Virgin Islands before moving first to Miami, then Tulsa, Okla., for his freshman year of high school, before returning to the island where he grew up.\n\nThrough his experiences, Garnett, now a doctoral student in the University of Washington College of Education\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/programs\/graduate\/edpol\/phd\">organizational and policy studies<\/a> program, developed a passion for supporting students who take an unconventional path.\n\nNow, Garnett is researching a trend in higher education known as \u201cundermatch.\u201d It\u2019s a phenomenon in which high-achieving students who attend low-income schools are less likely to apply to colleges that will help them achieve their full academic potential. These students are more likely to apply to local community colleges, if they decide to apply to college at all.\n\n\u201cI want to speak to these young people who should be applying to a certain set of colleges but aren\u2019t and ask \u2018Why is that?\u2019 Are we exposing students to a wide range of schools so that they understand what\u2019s out there? That\u2019s the issue.\u201d\n\nFrom his work, Garnett has found that community-based organizations (CBOs) are critical in reducing the information gap about what opportunities in higher education are available to young people. One example is the Rainier Scholars program in Seattle, a comprehensive 12-year program of academic preparation, leadership development and personalized support for\u00a0 students from low-income backgrounds. These students gain more exposure to information about potential college pathways. Beyond information, Garnett finds that CBOs provide high school students with relationships that foster accountability and encouragement.\n\nWhile at Bowdoin, Garnett got a call from Link Unlimited, another CBO, asking about how one of their students was doing. Garnett told them the student seemed fine, but Link Unlimited said he was considering dropping out of school. They asked Garnett to take the student out to lunch, but not to tell him about their phone call.\n\n\u201cI remember thinking, \u2018Wow. Not mom, not dad, not anyone from his school called me. I just got a call from this organization telling me to go have lunch with him.\u2019 The whole time they were working behind the scenes and making connections for the students.\u201d\n\nInspired by the success of Link Unlimited and other CBOs, Garnett has since co-designed and co-created a bridge program at Bowdoin, which will begin in 2019. This program will support students by connecting them with resources to enable their successful transition to campus.\n\nIn the future, he hopes to further limit the impacts of undermatch by providing students with information to make an educated decision about college. From that point, he feels that students need to be connected with resources and support to feel comfortable on campus.\n\n\u201cIf one person on the campus is going to help students make connections, before we know it, students are going to feel much more comfortable going to college. I know what it\u2019s like to feel uncomfortable and I also know what feels comfortable. Learning happens when you are comfortable, when you are at ease, which is the environment I want to create.\u201d"},{"title":"Doctoral student explores nuance of 'Blackness' in student experience","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/doctoral-student-explores-nuance-of-blackness-in-student-experience\/","tags":["college-of-education","graduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Growing up, Adaurennaya Onyewuenyi was a straight A student.

During a portion of the course that explored the pathways of various minoritized and immigrant groups, Onyewuenyi\u2014the daughter of Nigerian immigrants\u2014was struck by how all Black people were grouped together, regardless of their ethnicity or country of origin.\n\n\u201cMy professor said there was no research on those nuances of experience, and when I pushed on that, the professor told me, \u2018Maybe you should do some research on it\u2019,\u201d Onyewuenyi said. \u201cThat helped push me onto graduate school and my current path.\u201d\n\nNow a doctoral candidate in <a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/programs\/graduate\/educational-psychology\/learning-sciences-human-development\">learning sciences and human developmen<\/a>t at the University of Washington College of Education, Onyewuenyi is investigating how race, ethnicity, immigration, cultural norms and discrimination influence the academic trajectories of Black American and African immigrant high school students.\n\nShe recently was one of only six doctoral students in the country to receive an American Educational Research Association Minority Dissertation Fellowship to support her dissertation work focusing on Black American and Nigerian adolescents in the United States.\n\n\u201cAs Black immigrants our experience is really unique, but there\u2019s very little research taking a look at those experiences in education,\u201d she said.\n\nFor example, she pointed to her experience in high school, where a number of children of African immigrants, but no Black American students, were admitted into Advanced Placement classes.\n\n\u201cThat was the only time our immigrantness was an advantage in school,\u201d Onyewuenyi said. \u201cStudents\u2019 educational pathways are determined to a large degree by their interactions with teachers and guidance counselors, and there are many situations where these populations face discrimination.\u201d\n\nOnyewuenyi is surveying approximately 200 Black American and Nigerian youth across the United States for her dissertation and is currently analyzing that data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to give this information back to communities and share what the experiences of our youth are so that we can start thinking about policies that will help them succeed in school,\u201d she said.\n\nOnyewuenyi hopes to extend this research in the future, such as further exploration into how Black immigrant youth are acculturated into society.\n\n\u201cMy pie in sky dream would be to lead a research center that would look more closely at the African diaspora, including Afro-Latino and Caribbean populations, so we can better understand these nuances of Blackness in the U.S. and have more productive conversations as a nation about our young people and our future.\u201d"},{"title":"Creating spaces where students feel valued","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/creating-spaces-where-students-feel-valued\/","tags":["college-of-education","graduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"Whether it's in the classroom or after school, Pedro Navejas Rodriguez (U-ACT '13) is working to create spaces where all students feel valued.","content":"(College of Education, January 2018)\n\nWhether it\u2019s in the classroom or after school, Pedro Navejas Rodriguez (U-ACT \u201813) is working to create spaces where all students feel valued.\n\nThat desire brought Navejas Rodriguez, a first-generation college graduate, to Grandview Middle School where he teaches 8th grade journalism and language arts, as well as Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) and alternative learning methods classes.\n\n\u201cI am passionate about this school and population because I am interested in working with rural Latino migrant communities,\u201d said Navejas Rodriguez, who grew up in Jalisco, Mexico, and emigrated to the United States at age 8. \u201cI relate to them because I grew up in a similar way. I feel like I can connect with the families because I want to be an advocate for them.\u201d\n\nNavejas Rodriguez grew up in small towns comprised almost entirely of Latino migrants and their families, and remembers feeling intimidated by the size of the schools he attended. He had to travel to schools in neighboring cities, sometimes riding the bus for as many as 13 miles. Yet he excelled academically and, after graduating from college, entered Teach For America and was placed in the University of Washington\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/programs\/teacher\/u-act\">Accelerated Certification for Teachers (U-ACT) program<\/a> to earn his teaching certification.\n\nAt Grandview today, Navejas Rodriguez is advocating for migrant families by supporting increased academic rigor for their children. He serves on the district\u2019s curriculum council, which reviews and recommends new curricular materials to the school board and provides feedback on current use of curriculum for student learning.\n\n\u201cI am on the curriculum council because I want to put myself in those spaces to be part of the solution,\u201d Navejas Rodriguez said. \u201cOur community needs well-educated students and I see education as a primary social justice issue.\u201d\n\nDuring his time at Grandview, Navejas Rodriguez has taken up other efforts to help students feel valued. As a person who identifies as gay, Navejas Rodriguez initially sensed that it was not safe to share this aspect of his identity in his classroom or school.\n\nThen, one student approached him about starting a Gay Straight Alliance (GSA) club. Navejas Rodriguez advised the student that at least two people were needed to form a student organization.\n\n\u201cThe next day, they returned with another student. When the group grew to five students, I started to see that GSA was something that our school needed. I set aside my little worries and said, \u2018Let\u2019s do this.\u2019\u201d\n\nNavejas Rodriguez presented the idea to the school\u2019s staff, and three years later, the GSA has helped Grandview students who were truant start improving their attendance. Up to that point, LGBT students had not been feeling supported at school. Navejas Rodriguez\u2019 efforts to establish GSA have paid off, improving both student support and attendance rates. GSA meetings include various modes of artistic expression, such as slam poetry and physical art, through which students can convey images of their ideal school experience.\n\nAt Grandview, Navejas Rodriguez seeks to create spaces for belonging both in GSA meetings and in his classes. He recalls a unit where his 6th graders were analyzing texts, which led to the students reflecting on the documentary \u201cThe Masks We Wear.\u201d Students were asked to write a letter to a person they trust, describing the mask that they wear.\n\n\u201cThey were encouraged to ask the other person to respond in a letter as well. A student gave her letter to me which was totally unexpected. She explained what she thought that everyone saw in her and how she felt ugly and unworthy. I responded and told her that most characters in the books we read feel like her and how we all have doubts, but we need to focus on and recognize the things that we are good at. Afterwards, I could hear her saying the things that she was good at and telling people what she knew that she could accomplish.\u201d\n\nBy creating an environment where all students feel valuable and loved and empowering students to be themselves, Navejas Rodriguez is instilling a confidence in his students that will last well beyond their middle school years.\n\n\u201cI want to help my students feel safe and grounded, but also to know that the things they learn in class will change the real world,\u201d Navejas Rodriguez said. \u201cThe line I always say at the end of class was adapted from one that was said by my professors at the College of Education: \u201cBe kind to one another, it\u2019s an honor and a privilege to teach and learn with you.\u201d"},{"title":"Grid by grid","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/grid-by-grid\/","tags":["engineering","faculty","giving","graduate-student"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"Months after Hurricane Maria, thousands in rural Puerto Rico still lack electricity. In partnership with local communities, UW researchers are working to restore their power.","content":"(UW Homepage, May 2018)\n\nThe stout house built into a hillside in Jayuya, a rural municipality in the mountains of central Puerto Rico, hasn\u2019t been connected to the electrical grid for six months. Someone inside suffers from sleep apnea, and his family has relied on a noisy generator \u2014 and the gas it consumes \u2014 to power the machine he needs each night.\n\nOutside, under the thin smile of a crescent moon, four engineers from the University of Washington complete their work. Soon a new solar\/battery nanogrid will power the sleep-aid machine: no gas, no fumes, no cacophony.\n\nDoctoral students Mareldi Ahumada Par\u00e1s and Wesley Tatum secure four flexible solar panels to the roof using yellow rope. Anya Raj, \u201917, feeds wires from the panels through a hole in the roof, while sophomore Hugo Pontes illuminates Raj\u2019s efforts with his smartphone.\n\nThe team connects the panels to a battery inside the house that will be charged by tomorrow\u2019s sun. They finish just as the mosquitoes emerge.\n\nGETTING TO THE HEART OF THE DAMAGE\n\nAhumada, Tatum, Raj and Pontes are part of a team of UW engineers and public health scientists who are assessing the long-term impact of Puerto Rico\u2019s power loss on the health of rural residents.\n\nOver four days in late March 2018, the researchers crisscrossed this 39-square-mile region on single-lane switchbacks, some of which have narrowed sharply since Hurricane Maria struck the U.S. territory last September. Jayuya is home to the highest peaks in Puerto Rico \u2014 and 17,000 people.\n<ul>\n\t<li><\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThe team visited homes and community centers, interviewing dozens of caregivers and residents who use electronic medical devices, as part of a long-term field study on the impact of power loss on public health. They also donated and installed 17 solar\/battery nanogrid systems \u2014 prototypes of a sustainable, clean energy infrastructure that can buoy public health in rural areas when power grids fail.\n\nTheir work is supported by the UW\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cei.washington.edu\/\">Clean Energy Institute<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/globalaffairs\/gif\/\">Global Innovation Fund<\/a>, and it aligns with the <a href=\"https:\/\/uw.edu\/populationhealth\/\">Population Health Initiative<\/a>, a University-wide effort to eliminate health disparities around the world. Like many natural disasters, Hurricane Maria had a disproportionate effect on those with the fewest resources: low- and fixed-income families, the elderly, the sick and rural residents in places like Jayuya.\n\nThousands have remained disconnected from the electrical grid since Maria sliced through. The UW team hopes that the storm\u2019s lessons will help engineers develop better microgrids \u2014 like the prototypes they\u2019ve installed \u2014 for an infrastructure that meets the needs of the most vulnerable communities.\n\nAs the team has learned in their two trips here, the current infrastructure\u2019s shortcomings have left deeper scars than downed utility poles and darkened homes.\n\n\u201cIt is invisible suffering,\u201d says Lilo Pozzo, associate professor of chemical engineering, who has led both trips. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what the situation is until you go into homes and see exactly how people are getting by.\u201d\n\nUNCOVERING THE HIDDEN HARM\n\nBlue FEMA tarps are still common, but many overt signs of storm damage have been repaired: People have cleared debris, replaced windows and patched roofs. But the UW researchers have documented myriad \u201chidden\u201d adjustments that residents have made since losing power. These include eating canned and preserved food, despite the lower nutritional value, or making daily trips to a doctor\u2019s office for refrigerated medicine.\n\n\u201cYou adapt because you have to,\u201d says Pozzo. \u201cBut you never achieve the normal life you had back when you had power.\u201d\n\nPozzo chose Jayuya for this study because her spouse, Marvi Matos, a chemical engineer, grew up there. Like many with family ties to Puerto Rico, the couple sent supplies to the island after the hurricane. But a month after Maria, barely 20 percent of the electricity grid had been restored.\n\nPozzo and Matos envisioned using their expertise to unearth the storm\u2019s impact on health and energy infrastructure. Pozzo recruited partners from the School of Public Health and the College of Engineering. They received funding for the study from the Clean Energy Institute and the Global Innovation Fund, while private donations covered the cost of the nanogrids. Contacts in Jayuya connected them with community organizers and needy families.\n\n\u201cThis storm\u2019s lasting impact is that it uncovered the vulnerable places of Jayuya,\u201d says Maria P\u00e9rez, a local community organizer. \u201cIt showed us the people in our midst who didn\u2019t have help, who were living in inhumane conditions.\u201d\n\nDEDICATED TO A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE\n\nThe UW team first visited Jayuya in November 2017, gathering data and donating four solar\/battery systems. They expanded their goals for the March trip, buying and assembling three types of solar\/battery systems. The smallest can power a miniature refrigerator for storing medical supplies like insulin, while the largest can power more complex devices, such as an oxygen concentrator or a full-size refrigerator.\n\n\u201cWe want these systems to be simple for the patients and their caregivers,\u201d Ahumada says. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in donating something that they\u2019re unable to use easily.\u201d\n\nThe researchers also installed 11 data loggers into some of the nanogrids. These devices will record information on energy use for download during future visits.\n\n\u201cWe can combine the information that the data loggers record with information from the interviews to design even more effective microgrids,\u201d says Chanaka Keerthisinghe, a postdoctoral researcher in electrical engineering.\n\nThe data that the researchers collected in March, which should offer clues to more needs they can help uncover and address, awaits analysis. The team is planning another trip to Jayuya this summer. Partners in the community stand ready to assist in their efforts.\n\nAfter installing their final nanogrid, the UW team passed a boy playing in front of his powerless house. He was wearing a Captain America costume and saluting passing cars. A nearby house sported the island\u2019s flag with a handwritten message: <i>Puerto Rico se levanta<\/i>.\n\n<b>Puerto Rico rises.<\/b>"},{"title":"Using infosonics to tap into the emotional side of climate change","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/using-infosonics-to-tap-into-the-emotional-side-of-climate-change\/","tags":["college-of-the-environment","graduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"When the U.S. pulled out of the Paris Agreement, Judy Tweet started to think differently about her work on climate change. \"It was a turning point for me.

It creates new cultural affiliations to science,\u201d says Twedt. \u201cYour whole body listens to music, unlike reading and other mediums. The vibrations are felt throughout your body, and it really does access different pathways in your nervous system. Sound is really helpful for making sense of something as complex as climate change.\u201d\n\nSo what does this sound like? So far, she has sonified data related to <a href=\"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/user-561624283\/sonification-of-arctic-sea-ice\">sea ice change<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/Y45Mm-EHcxs\">carbon dioxide<\/a> concentrations in our atmosphere, and ocean acidification\u2014and more are on the way.

She has since shared her work through multiple outlets, including on social media and with organizations like science and labor societies. When presenting the soundtrack on ocean acidification to a class recently, students put down their phones and instead intently focused on the music. It is sharp and complicated, yet hauntingly beautiful. One student told Twedt that hearing the data put to sound made him feel more saddened by what is happening. A chemistry teacher who heard her piece at a conference remarked that she thought global warming was \u2018made up by the alarmists\u2019 until hearing her presentation on the sonification of Arctic sea ice.\n\n\u201cI was moved by that,\u201d says Twedt. \u201cBeing able to access the emotional side of communication is something younger scientists are receptive to. It\u2019s a new way to connect.\u201d\n\nTwedt\u2019s own pathway has been an evolving one. Born in Tacoma, she felt a strong connection to the landscapes and places of Washington, and moved back to her home state after going to college in Colorado. She had majored in philosophy and environmental ethics, but was drawn to how math and physics help us understand climate change. Entering her PhD program at UW, she wanted to focus on science that would help in decision making. Her current work blends her interests from the past while introducing a new element: music and sound.\n\n\u201cInitially I wanted to be a seagoing oceanographer. But I felt compelled to work where I could make the most impact and that eventually led to working on this huge communication gap between climate scientists and ordinary people. Music is a way to fill that.\u201d\n\nJudy Twedt is currently doing her dissertation research in the College of the Environment and College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Washington.

But it\u2019s a necessary skill for all geologists to have, and we\u2019ll put it to use creating stratigraphic columns tomorrow at Frying Pan.\n\nDay 4\n\nBeing in the field is brilliant.\n\nDay 9\n\nIt\u2019s my birthday today and our first day off. Coincidence? I don\u2019t think so. We celebrated by hiking to an abandoned garnet pit mine. Our rockhounding paid off because we saw garnets, epidote, quartz and pyrite.\n\nDay 11\n\nBlock Mountain\u2019s complicated geology has me second-guessing things I thought I knew. Not to mention, how are we going to map five miles in six days in this 90\u00b0 heat?\n\nDay 12\n\nYesterday, I was disheartened. Today, I woke up ready to attack the task at-hand. My partner and I devised a crafty plan to map the west quadrant of Block Mountain more effectively and efficiently. Tomorrow, we conquer the Rat\u2019s Nest.\n\nDay 13\n\nI\u2019m hitting my stride. I\u2019m getting better and better at mapping features from a distance and recognizing formations as I approach.\n\nGlacier National Park\n\nDay 19\n\nLast night at Sun River Canyon, we stayed up late by the campfire, roasted s\u2019mores and listened to music alongside the river and under a dense blanket of stars. We should reach Glacier tomorrow morning.\n\nDay 20\n\nIt\u2019s beautiful here, and I\u2019ve had a few quiet moments to reflect on all I\u2019ve learned through this experience so far. At times though, I\u2019m reminded of how much I still have to learn.\n\nDay 21\n\nConfession: I\u2019m afraid of heights. Piegan Pass led us through wildflower meadows and culminated in a view of the neighboring valley. But when the path got too narrow, I stayed behind. I napped on flat boulders with a gorgeous view of adjacent glaciers through the trees.\n\nBack in Dillon\n\nDay 24\n\nWe\u2019re dealing with two sedimentary units composed of volcanic ash and tuff \u2014 which look nearly identical \u2014 at Timber Hill. I\u2019m up for the challenge.\n\nDay 26\n\nMy partner and I think we\u2019ve figured out how two billion years of geologic records could have disappeared from the area. I finally feel like I know what I\u2019m doing and like I can (and should) enter the field every day with confidence, knowing I can get the job done. I finished my map and cross section early tonight, so I went into town to shoot pool at the Moose.\n\nDay 31\n\nMy classmates ran into a mama bear, her cub and a moose today.\n\nDay 33\n\nFive weeks ago, I was overwhelmed by the workload here and had many skills left to learn. Today, I\u2019m identifying rocks in the field and defending those identifications when my classmates disagree. I\u2019m quickly and accurately making maps and stratigraphy columns, and I\u2019m able to mentally piece together billions of years of geologic history. Earth and Space Sciences field camp proves how much you can learn and grow in a short period.\n\nDay 37\n\nToday is our last day in the field. Just two more Price Creek transects to survey!\n\nDay 38\n\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot together in the last six weeks. Tonight, we celebrate.\n\nDay 40\n\nDuring today\u2019s fieldtrip to the Ruby Range, I saw ultramafics. ULTRAMAFICS. It\u2019s not every day that you see a rock that exists deep in Earth\u2019s mantle exposed on the surface. And if that weren\u2019t enough, we also saw a cougar \u2014 it was massive.\n\nDay 41\n\nField camp was physically daunting, but also incredibly empowering. More than holding my own, I can thrive when I\u2019m thrown into the deep-end. I\u2019m more confident than ever in my ability to ID rocks, make observations and work through all the possible ways geologic formations came to be.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t trade this experience for the world."},{"title":"Research on West Coast fisheries and human nutrition receives pilot grant form UW Population Health Initiative","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/research-on-west-coast-fisheries-and-human-nutrition-receives-pilot-grant-form-uw-population-health-initiative\/","tags":["college-of-the-environment","graduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"\"Our work is part of a movement to democratize local food movements and make them more accessible to more people.\"","content":"(College of the Environment, October 2017)\n\nCan tapping into West Coast fisheries support human health and nutrition?

Right now, Allison explains, West Coast fisheries do not target most of these small \u201cfishy flavored\u201d species because of consumer taste preferences and economic incentives to catch a few popular species, like halibut and rockfish. When they are caught, these fish are sold for animal and aquaculture feed or discarded as bycatch. However, the West Coast is home to many peoples from traditional maritime cultures who would welcome the inexpensive fish into their diets.\n\nAllison\u2019s team, comprised of fisheries, public health and policy scientists, sees an opportunity to connect low-income communities with these healthy, more affordable fish.\n\n\u201cGood quality, nutritious food can be inexpensive,\u201d Allison says. \u201cOur work is part of a movement to democratize local food movements and make them more accessible to more people.\u201d\n\nAllison hopes that his team\u2019s research will: determine West Coast fisheries\u2019 potential to support population health in local coastal communities; name current barriers that prevent nutritious, underused fish from reaching people who need them; and explore possible pathways to connect fisheries with communities \u2014 like having small community-supported fisheries deliver their bycatch to schools and meal programs. If the team identifies fishing policy and practice changes that could increase the supply of nutritious fish, those pathways could create new opportunities for organizations like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seashare.org\/\">SeaShare<\/a>, a nonprofit that currently partners with fishermen to donate unsold fish to food banks.\n\nManaging fisheries for nutrition could also have positive environmental impacts.\n\n\u201cRight now, we target a very specific number of species and thus take large chunks out of the ecosystem,\u201d says Allison. \u201cWe have a huge diversity of fishes on the West Coast. There are a lot of edible things out there. It\u2019s possible that by fishing for more species or more ages of fish overall, we could take smaller amounts of each kind from the ocean, which would have a less dramatic impact than removing, say, just the larger fish in the marine system.\u201d\n\nThe Population Health Initiative pilot research grant encourages new interdisciplinary collaborations among investigators for projects that address critical components of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/populationhealth\/focusing-on-solutions-to-grand-challenges\/\">grand challenges<\/a> the UW seeks to address in population health.

In Ohio \u2014 where she\u2019d moved from \u2014 there were more than 70.\n\n\u201cToy libraries provide play experiences for children and families, especially for kids with disabilities,\u201d the bioengineering Ph.D. student explains. \u201cNot all toys are accessible to all kids, depending on their abilities \u2014 for example, a child with spinal muscular atrophy may not be able to reach or push small buttons on electronic toys.\u201d\n\nIn fact, many children with disabilities often cannot access toys as they were originally designed. This inability to interact with a toy means that the child cannot gain the developmental benefits of play, such as learning cause and effect, developing motor skills and increasing independence.\n\nSome manufacturers offer modified versions of toys; however, they generally cost much more than original models. As an undergraduate at Ohio State University, Mollica learned that she could apply basic engineering and circuitry skills to adapt toys for local libraries at a fraction of the cost.\n\nMechanical engineering (ME) master\u2019s student Brianna Goodwin had a similar experience. While an undergraduate at Oregon State University, she got involved with <a href=\"https:\/\/health.oregonstate.edu\/gobabygo\">Go Baby Go<\/a>, a program that modifies battery-operated ride-on cars for young children to meet their unique mobility needs.\n\n\u201cGo Baby Go didn\u2019t have a presence on the UW campus when I arrived, and I wanted to change that,\u201d she says.\n\nNot long after beginning their graduate programs, Goodwin and Mollica met each other. They also connected with ME assistant professor Kat Steele, whose research is situated at the intersections of universal design, accessibility and inclusive community building.\n\n\u201cWith assistive technology and accessible design, there\u2019s a lot of room for fresh ideas and innovation, so it\u2019s a great space for student energy,\u201d Steele says.\n\nSteele, Goodwin and Mollica contacted other researchers, educators and clinicians, including human centered design and engineering professor Dianne Hendricks; Anat Caspi, who directs the <a href=\"https:\/\/tcat.cs.washington.edu\/\">Taskar Center for Accessible Technology<\/a> in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering; Heather Feldner, a pediatric physical therapist and disability researcher in Steele\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/uwsteele\/\">Ability &amp; Innovation Lab<\/a>; and Shawn Israel, a pediatric physical therapist and staff member in UW Rehabilitation Medicine. Feldner and Israel were beginning to develop a local Go Baby Go chapter, so the timing was ideal. The faculty knew students who were interested in accessible design, and soon a campus network began to form around accessible play technology.\n\n<b>Adapting toys and building community<\/b>\n\n\u201cWith a few simple instructions, modifying an electronic toy is surprisingly simple process with a lot of positive impact and educational benefits,\u201d Mollica explains. \u201cTo adapt a toy, you open it and assess its circuitry, then you solder a headphone jack in parallel with the original activation switch, which allows you to activate the toy by pushing a large button or whatever sort of activation option works for the child using it.\u201d\n\nMollica began working with Caspi to organize regular toy adaptation workshops on campus. Interest in them grew quickly, so to cover the costs, she and the team applied for and received <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/strategicplanning\/husky-seed-fund\/\">Husky Seed Fund<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/doit\/programs\/accessengineering\/overview\">AccessEngineering<\/a> grants.\n\nWhile she focused growing the momentum around the workshops, Goodwin worked with Steele and other faculty to outline a plan to develop a student organization, which they named <a href=\"https:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/adaptuw\/\">HuskyADAPT<\/a> (short for Accessible Design &amp; Play Technology).\n\nThey focused the new club\u2019s efforts into three project areas: 1) toy adaptations, 2) Go Baby Go modified cars and 3) individualized design projects, some of which integrated with a <a href=\"https:\/\/vip.uw.edu\/\">VIP course<\/a> that Steele leads.\n\n\u201cProfessor Steele\u2019s lab has become a hub for individuals in the Puget Sound community who want or need assisted living devices and innovations,\u201d says Goodwin. \u201cShe compiles project ideas and transforms them into student-led research and design projects. The club then gives students a structure and supportive community through which to pursue them.\u201d\n\n<b>Advancing accessible design<\/b>\n\nIn its first year, HuskyADAPT has trained more than 300 students and community members in toy adaptation. Students from across campus regularly participate in the club\u2019s events and meetings.\n\n\u201cThe interdisciplinarity of HuskyADAPT is exciting,\u201d says Goodwin. \u201cI can\u2019t think of many project-based student organizations that bring together engineering students with future physical and occupational therapists and educators.\u201d\n\nThe club has also been collaborating with students from Inglemoor High School in Kenmore, Washington, to adapt ride-on cars for local preschoolers with disabilities. During winter quarter, HuskyADAPT students worked with Inglemoor\u2019s engineering and design technology instructor Michael Wierusz, BSME \u201999, to create a Go Baby Go design project for one of his senior classes. Club members visited Inglemoor twice a week to teach accessible design and mentor students.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the project, the high schoolers visited a local preschool to see first-hand how the cars helped children be more independent and have an increased ability to explore,\u201d Goodwin says.\n\nLooking ahead, club members hope to deepen and expand their connections with community partners. They\u2019re also eager to establish relationships with local businesses.\n\n\u201cBy equipping others with the accessible design knowledge and the skills to adapt and adjust toys, HuskyADAPT is making it possible for more kids and families in the Seattle area to access toys that best fit their needs,\u201d says Mollica.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t stop there.\n\n\u201cThe club also provides students with valuable skills they will take into their careers,\u201d adds Steele. \u201cIf we can train engineering students in accessible and inclusive design today, we can help create a more diverse and prepared engineering workforce for tomorrow.\u201d"},{"title":"Careful coexistence","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/careful-coexistence\/","tags":["engineering","graduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"CEE doctoral student Molly Grear studies whale blubber to determine how marine mammals may be impacted by tidal turbines.","content":"(College of Engineering, May 2018)\n\n<b>CEE Ph.D. student studies whales and renewable energy, recognized by Forbes<\/b>\n\nThe majority of people don\u2019t spend much time thinking about blubber. But for Ph.D. student Molly Grear, it\u2019s the primary focus of her research.\n\n\u201cI set out to answer an environmental question and ended up fascinated by how blubber works,\u201d Grear said.\n\nStretching whale blubber to determine how pliable it is enables Grear to assess how marine mammals, such as killer whales in the Puget Sound, may be impacted by the spinning blades of tidal turbines, an emerging form of renewable energy.\n\nTidal turbines, which look like underwater windmills, are not widely used in the United States, although they are more common in Europe. The development and commercialization of tidal turbines has been slowed by a number of factors, most notably the potential to harm marine mammals.\n\nIn recognition of her work in the energy field, Grear, 28, was named to <i>Forbes<\/i> magazine\u2019s list of the top 30 people under the age of 30 who are working on energy initiatives with the goal of creating a more sustainable future. The magazine profiles \u201ca group of upstarts, judged by our sources and judges, to be among the most promising individuals working across the broad field of anything even tangentially \u2018energy\u2019 related.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe work I do is charismatic and marine animals are charismatic,\u201d Grear humbly said about the award.\n\n<b>What about the whales? A problem surfaces<\/b>\n\nWhile marine renewable energy is gaining interest as a way to combat climate change, the impact on marine wildlife has not been widely studied. In the Seattle area, environmental conservation groups and regulatory agencies began voicing concerns around 2010 that tidal turbines may harm killer whales in Puget Sound. At the time, two turbines were proposed on the east side of Admiralty Inlet, situated between the Olympic Peninsula and Whidbey Island.\n\nGrear began addressing this concern while working as a research assistant for Pacific Northwest National Laboratory after earning her bachelor\u2019s degree at Dartmouth College. She spent three years investigating the potential environmental impacts of installing various ocean energy devices. When she decided to pursue a Ph.D., Grear wanted to continue investigating the topic and obtained funding through a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.\n\n\u201cMolly is among the most motivated and curious students I have come across at UW,\u201d said assistant professor Michael Motley, Grear\u2019s faculty adviser. \u201cShe came in on day one with a research direction, and because of her NSF graduate research fellowship she has had the freedom to develop and lead a distinct research path that is uniquely her own.\u201d\n\n<b>Blubber and blades: Assessing risk\u00a0<\/b>\n\nWhile tidal turbines may have a number of negative impacts on marine mammals, including increased noise, the most commonly discussed issue is blade strike. To determine the potential damage that tidal turbines may cause to marine mammals, Grear investigates two factors: the biomechanical properties of marine mammal skin and blubber and the probability that marine mammals will be in close proximity to tidal turbines.\n\nTo evaluate the biomechanical properties of marine mammals, Grear studies their skin and blubber to determine if it is resilient enough to protect them from potential blunt force trauma encountered in a tidal blade collision. Grear has found that resilience is largely determined by the layers of skin and blubber that together create a stronger material that can absorb forces without breaking.\n\n\u201cThe multiple layers have different material properties, each with a different function, that can protect the animal better,\u201d Grear said.\n\nAfter first modeling the forces that a turbine blade might have on a marine mammal, Grear tests tissue resilience using the same methods used to study the material properties of steel and concrete. The data is then combined to create a model showing potential risk.\n\n\u201cIn the Structures Lab, people pull big things apart,\u201d Grear said. \u201cI do this on a tiny scale machine.\u201d\n\nEvery few months, Grear travels to Friday Harbor Labs, a marine biology field station located on San Juan Island, where she spends a few days at a time testing tissue samples of various marine mammals, from killer whales to harbor porpoises to harbor seals. During the summer months, she often collects fresh tissue samples at weekly necropsies organized by researchers on the island when marine mammals wash up on the shore.\n\nThe second factor that Grear evaluates is how close marine mammals may potentially be to a tidal turbine. She models the probability of collision using a variety of existing data such as swimming speed, dive depth, water depth and blade speed.\n\n\u201cThis approach shows that overall the likelihood of event is small,\u201d Grear said. \u201cThis has some downsides, though, in the sense that there is no behavioral component.\u201d\n\n<b>Coexistence conclusion<\/b>\n\nWith a better understanding of the nature of marine mammal tissue, coupled with the small likelihood that they would encounter blade strikes, Grear believes that marine mammals and turbines can coexist. Modifying the technology can help counteract some risks, she said, by configuring blades that slow down when animals approach or modifying the shape of turbines so they are less likely to strike marine mammals.\n\n\u201cThe fact that not all collisions cause damage combined with the unlikely event of a collision because the animals are smart and likely to avoid the turbines makes this a risk we can live with,\u201d Grear said.\n\nTo disseminate her findings, Grear has published two peer-reviewed papers, as well as additional conference papers and technical reports.\n\n\u201cMolly\u2019s work has focused on improving the understanding of how marine mammals would respond to blade strikes to better inform the marine energy community as they design various prototypes,\u201d Motley said.\n\n<b>Putting passion into practice<\/b>\n\nAs Grear closes in on the end of her graduate studies, and prepares to graduate this summer, she is exploring career opportunities. She is open to a variety of positions, including faculty positions, post-docs and even policy fellowships in Washington D.C.\n\nDuring her graduate studies, Grear developed an interest in teaching and worked with Washington SeaGrant to coordinate K-12 Science, Technology, Engineering and Math outreach for middle school and high school students. She organized renewable energy outreach events on campus, demonstrating tidal turbines at Harris Hydraulics Lab.\n\n\u201cI like that the kids can see what a scientist does,\u201d Grear said. \u201cI really enjoy learning about pedagogy and how to get people to learn.\u201d\n\nGrear aspires to continue working on marine technology, with a slightly different angle. Her \u201cdream research\u201d is engineering new technology in the ocean that takes advantage of existing biology and how animals interact in their environment. An example is creating shoreline protection comprised of barnacles, which naturally adhere to surfaces.\n\n\u201cRather than putting something in the ocean and hoping the biology won\u2019t bother it, using what is there,\u201d Grear said. \u201cThat is the big dream. Those types of projects make me excited.\u201d"},{"title":"A robot confidant","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/a-robot-confidant\/","tags":["faculty","undergraduate-student","tacoma"],"pillars":["innovation"],"image":"","excerpt":"Meet EMAR, a social robot being developed by UW researchers to better understand teen stress and emotional well-being.","content":"(College of Engineering, March 2018)\n\n\u201cHow many of you feel stressed at school?\u201d When Elin Bj\u00f6rling asks a group of Seattle high school students this question, every hand shoots in the air.\n\nBj\u00f6rling, a human centered design and engineering (HCDE) research scientist who studies teen stress, is not surprised.\n\n\u201cTeens experience stress more so than any other age group, and that stress can negatively impact their mental and physical health,\u201d she says.\n\nYet when it comes to stress research, more studies are needed to understand vulnerable adolescents. According to Bj\u00f6rling, researchers lack quality data to understand how, when and why stress occurs in teens or what normal, healthy stress looks like.\n\nEnter EMAR, a friendly little robot being developed by UW researchers with big hopes of disrupting this data void. Bj\u00f6rling is leading this research team with UW Tacoma Interdisciplinary Arts &amp; Sciences (IAS) assistant professor and HCDE alumna Emma Rose and Maya Cakmak, an assistant professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering.\n\nKnown as <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.uw.edu\/emar\/\">Project EMAR<\/a>, their cross-campus, cross-disciplinary team of faculty, undergraduates and graduate students is creating a social robot that will help schools better measure and understand stress. The goal is to design a social robot who would live in a high school and collect data on students\u2019 emotional well-being. The project is supported by the National Science Foundation\u2019s National Robotics Initiative.\n\n<b>Why use a robot?<\/b>\n\nAlthough there is a great deal of research on human-robot interaction, including focused studies on specific age groups like children and seniors, little exists on teen-robot interaction. EMAR\u2019s researchers see this as an opportunity.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s teens will likely be the first generation to spend a lifetime interacting with robots,\u201d explains HCDE junior Wesley Muthemba, who has been involved with the EMAR project since Autumn 2017. \u201cSo in addition to gathering important data related to adolescent stress, our project will help fill in some human-robot interaction research gaps, which is exciting.\u201d\n\nMuthemba is one of approximately 30 students who have helped shape Project EMAR through independent studies and directed research groups. Students from across the College of Engineering, the Information School and UW Tacoma have participated in all stages of research, design and robot prototyping.\n\nThe team is designing EMAR to use a research methodology called Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) to gather real-time data, which is where EMAR\u2019s name comes from.\n\n\u201cThe team realized early on that if we\u2019re going to ask teens to share real-time feedback, we needed to provide them with a cool, interesting way to do so,\u201d says Muthemba. \u201cSo why not give them a social robot to interact with?\u201d\n\n<b>Cute, not creepy<\/b>\n\nTo ensure that EMAR\u2019s end-users \u2014 high school students \u2014 will feel comfortable engaging with the robot, the team has held multiple user-focused sessions with teens.\n\n\u201cHigh school wasn\u2019t that long ago for me, and I thought I had a good idea of how the teens would respond,\u201d says HCDE junior Rachel Ren, the project\u2019s undergraduate research assistant. \u201cBut one of the first things we learn in HCDE is to let go of our assumptions and listen objectively, and I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve taken this approach because we\u2019ve learned so much!\u201d\n\nFor example, the team discovered that the students overwhelming preferred simple, approachable robot designs to sophisticated models, which could seem intimidating.\n\n\u201cOver and again, we\u2019ve been told that EMAR has to be cute, not creepy,\u201d says Rose.\n\nBased on teen input, the team has created two robot prototypes and is working on two more. EMAR\u2019s first iteration, a squatty, boxy robot, has large round static eyes and a simple, hand-drawn smile. The second is taller with dynamic, digitally responsive eyes. Both feature a touch screen for information gathering.\n\nTeens also reported a desire to know that EMAR cares about them, which Rose says, has been interesting to think about in terms of robot design.\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean to care? How do you communicate that in a robot? Doing so has been a major focus of our recent prototyping,\u201d she adds.\n\nTo convey awareness and expression, researchers have scripted EMAR\u2019s eyes to move and blink. They\u2019ve also programmed EMAR to respond verbally to teen input and are exploring the best types of verbal responses for it deliver.\n\n\u201cDo students want EMAR to suggest solutions that might help them feel better, or do they just want to be heard? What should EMAR\u2019s voice sound like? These are some of the big questions that we\u2019re thinking about right now,\u201d says Rose.\n\nThe researchers have also learned that students are curious about EMAR\u2019s race and gender.\n\n\u201cIt never crossed our minds to design for race or gender, but it\u2019s been interesting to observe how soon students want to know if EMAR is a boy or a girl,\u201d says Bj\u00f6rling. \u201cThis has prompted us to think about how race and gender are communicated and, as designers, how mindful we need to be about our roles in that process.\u201d\n\n<b>Potential for impact<\/b>\n\nUsing a robot to collect information about students raises privacy concerns. To address this, the data will be collected and stored anonymously.\n\n\u201cEMAR is an assessment tool,\u201d explains Bj\u00f6rling. \u201cIt isn\u2019t intended to single out specific individuals but to compile and aggregate data that schools can use to better understand their student body as a whole.\u201d\n\nSchool administrators and teachers will be able to use EMAR\u2019s data to determine ways to implement change \u2014 introduce a new after-school program, host wellness events, increase counseling services, reduce students\u2019 academic workload \u2014 and measure the effectiveness of that intervention. It can also help teens develop more self-awareness and a deeper understanding of their school environment.\n\n\u201cEMAR will serve as a good reminder for teens to take a minute and pay attention to their stress, to talk to their friends or a counselor about it,\u201d Bj\u00f6rling adds.\n\nIn the meantime, EMAR is proving to be an inspirational outreach and teaching tool, encouraging high school students to envision themselves as robot designers. This winter, students from seven Puget Sound high schools have been participating in a <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/designme\/\">social robot design challenge<\/a> in which they\u2019ve designed and created robot prototypes to live in their schools and help students deal with stress. The <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/designme\/\">Design Challenge Showcase<\/a> will take place on March 24 from 3-5 p.m. on the UW campus.\n\n\u201cDeveloping EMAR with high school students has been one of the best parts of Project EMAR,\u201d says Ren. \u201cThe teens involved with EMAR are our collaborators and co-designers, not just our end-users. And we couldn\u2019t be doing this work without them.\u201d"},{"title":"A meeting of minds","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/a-meeting-of-minds\/","tags":["engineering","faculty"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"Eric Chudler has traveled to India nearly every year since 2011 to teach neuroscience to Tibetan Buddhist monastics through the \"Science of Monks\" educational program.","content":"(College of Engineering, March 2018)\n\nEric Chudler has traveled to India nearly every year since 2011 to teach neuroscience to Tibetan Buddhist monastics through the \u201cScience for Monks\u201d educational program.\n\nPalpung Sherabling is not an easy place to reach. The Tibetan Buddhist monastery is nestled in northern India\u2019s Kangra Valley near the village of Bir. Surrounded by 30 acres of pine forest and against a backdrop of the Himalayas, it\u2019s about a three-hour drive from Dharamsala, the nearest city. Like other Tibetan settlements in India, it\u2019s a remote site, serving to preserve and advance Tibetan Buddhism by educating the next generation of monks and nuns.\n\nThis monastery is one of several that bioengineering research professor Eric Chudler has visited as part of <a href=\"http:\/\/scienceformonks.org\/\">Science for Monks<\/a>, a program connecting scientists and educators with the exiled Tibetan monastic community. It is a product of the Dalai Lama\u2019s interest in integrating western science into the curriculum for Tibetan Buddhist monks and nuns. Since 2011, Chudler \u2014 who serves as executive and education director of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csne-erc.org\/\">Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering<\/a> (CSNE) \u2014 has made six trips to colleges and monasteries across India to teach introductory neuroscience classes for it.\n\n\u201cBuddhist monastics receive a tremendous amount of education \u2014 especially philosophical training in logic and debate and in contemplative practices like meditation \u2014 but they don\u2019t have much exposure to western science,\u201d he explains. \u201cBecause of Buddhism\u2019s deep exploration of consciousness and the mind, neuroscience has become a key point of intersection.\u201d\n\nChudler was invited to participate in Science for Monks in part because of his work with <a href=\"http:\/\/faculty.washington.edu\/chudler\/neurok.html\">Neuroscience for Kids<\/a>, an online resource he launched in 1996 to help middle school teachers teach kids about the brain and nervous system.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like a good challenge, which meant it was a good opportunity,\u201d he says. He accepted immediately.\n\n<b>Why teach neuroscience to monks?<\/b>\n\nHow do brains work? What are thoughts? Where do emotions come from? Why are we self-aware? Although their approaches differ \u2014 neuroscientists rely on observation and empirical data to inform their conclusions while Buddhists draw from personal experiences with meditation and mindfulness \u2014 both have long been investigating these questions to better understand the nature of the mind.\n\n\u201cWe all have brains and nervous systems, we\u2019re equipped with sensory organs and ways to process what we feel, hear, see and so on,\u201d Chudler says. \u201cBasically, we\u2019re all walking talking laboratories and can explore and test within ourselves.\u201d\n\nIn this way, Chudler\u2019s approach to teaching neuroscience aligns with Tibetan Buddhism\u2019s emphasis on first-person study of conscious experience. He begins his classes with introductory material \u2014 lessons about brain anatomy, the nervous system and general physiology \u2013 and combines his lectures with interactive activities designed to demonstrate brain function and its role in controlling the senses, learning, memory and perception.\n\nTranslation tends to present the biggest challenge; the monks and nuns speak little English, and Chudler speaks no Tibetan, so he relies heavily on translators and in-class demonstrations. He draws from his Neuroscience for Kids curriculum and outreach activities developed through the CSNE; both provide a solid foundation for anyone new to neuroscience, children and adults alike.\n\n\u201cIn the lecture portion of a class, with the help of a translator, I present a concept \u2014 a sensory experience, for example, such as the sense of touch \u2014 and explain the pathway involved from physical touch to sensation,\u201d he says. \u201cThen we break into small groups to experiment with related activities, such as testing reflexes or mapping the sensitivity of the skin on different places of the body.\u201d\n\nHis favorite lessons are those that encourage friendly competition.\n\n\u201cThe monks are surprisingly competitive and like games in which they can compete against each other in a lighthearted way,\u201d he says.\n\nChudler also enjoys introducing activities that challenge his students\u2019 memory skills.\n\nFor example, in one memory activity, he shows pictures of 20 objects at a rate of one per second and asks the students to memorize and then recall all of the objects they see. Most can recall all of the objects without much difficulty.\n\n\u201cTibetan Buddhist monastics rely on memorization and recitation to learn spiritual teachings,\u201d he explains. \u201cAs a result, many of my monastic students have incredibly sharp memory skills, which has been fascinating to observe.\u201d\n\n<b>Neuroscience and neuroethics<\/b>\n\nChudler also incorporates neuroethics \u2014 an exploration of the ethical issues that arise from neuroscience and neural engineering technologies \u2014 into his classes.\n\n\u201cThe Tibetan monastic community has been investigating the nature of mind for hundreds of years,\u201d he says. \u201cThe monastics have a lot to say about it but their voice has not been heard by western researchers, so in many ways, they represent an untapped community of thinkers on this subject.\u201d\n\nIn late 2016, Chudler introduced then-CSNE post-doctoral researcher Laura Specker Sullivan to Bryce Johnson, the director of Science for Monks. Specker Sullivan\u2019s background is in cross-cultural bioethics and philosophy, and Johnson invited her to develop a class on issues and debates in western neuroethics to complement Chudler\u2019s neuroscience class. While teaching in India, she also conducted several ethnographic studies with the monks and nuns to understand their philosophical approach to addressing ethical issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m interested in articulating this approach in a way that\u2019s helpful for scientists and ethicists who are trying to work through these issues in their own research,\u201d she explains.\n\nNow at <a href=\"http:\/\/bioethics.hms.harvard.edu\/\">Harvard Medical School\u2019s Center for Bioethics<\/a>, she plans to publish her findings in the coming year.\n\n<b>Benefits<\/b>\n\nWhile there are fundamental differences between Buddhism\u2019s and neuroscience\u2019s foundational principles \u2014 for example, Buddhists believe that the brain and mind are separate, whereas western neuroscience understands the mind as a product of the brain \u2014 both Chudler and Specker Sullivan agree that, just as the monastics benefit from exchanging ideas with western scientists, so, too, do the scientists.\n\n\u201cThe Science for Monks students are some of the best students I\u2019ve ever taught,\u201d Chudler says. \u201cTheir thirst for knowledge is fantastic, and their questions push me to think about my work in new ways.\u201d\n\nMany of the teachings he\u2019s developed through Science for Monks have helped inform CSNE outreach activities. And, though not his areas of study, Chudler notes the recent growth of scientific interest in exploring the effects that core Buddhist practices may have on the brain and body. For example, at places such as Stanford University\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/ccare.stanford.edu\/\">Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education<\/a> and the University of Wisconsin-Madison\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/centerhealthyminds.org\/about\/overview\">Center for Healthy Minds<\/a>, researchers are investigating meditation\u2019s effect on the brain and conducting scientific studies on compassion and altruistic behavior.\n\nSpecker Sullivan also sees value in the ways that western science and Tibetan Buddhism push each other to define the values and the assumptions that underlie each\u2019s methodological structure.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, Buddhism challenges western science to articulate its goals: Does science improve society? If so, in what ways? Similarly, science challenges Buddhism to provide rigorous evidence for some of its claims. For example, could the idea of reincarnation be supported scientifically, and if so, how?\u201d she asks.\n\nAbove all, both believe that more forward-thinking collaborations and open discussions between scientific and Tibetan Buddhist communities will bring new understanding to the nature of mind, ultimately benefitting monastics and neuroscientists alike.\n\n\u201cScience has so many unanswerPalpunSPeed questions, so the more diverse viewpoints and perspectives we can bring to the conversation, the more we\u2019ll advance the field,\u201d Chudler says."},{"title":"Undaunted determination","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/undaunted-determination\/","tags":["engineering","graduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Nearing completion of a dual Ph.D. in aerospace engineering and astrobiology, Osazonamen Igbinosun reflects on her journey from U.S. Navy pilot to UW engineer, scientist and mentor.","content":"(College of Engineering, February 2018)\n\nAerospace engineer, astrobiologist, navy pilot, educator and mentor \u2014 by the time she completes her doctoral degree next year, these entries will all appear on Osazonamen Igbinosun\u2019s resume.\n\nAt the UW, Igbinosun has combined her passion for engineering, aviation and space through a dual Ph.D. program in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aa.washington.edu\/\">aeronautics and astronautics<\/a> (A&amp;A) and <a href=\"https:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/astrobio\/drupal\/\">astrobiology<\/a>. Her research explores how to use resources found on astronomical bodies such as the moon, Mars and asteroids so that when humans begin visiting these extraterrestrial sites they won\u2019t need to transport as many materials from Earth. Igbinosun is specifically interested in figuring out how to extract water from the subsurface of Mars.\n\nSimilar to a space mission, her research journey has been rigorous, layered and complex.\n\n\u201cIt took me a while to realize that all of my life experiences to this point have prepared me for where I am today,\u201d she says. \u201cWith A&amp;A, I\u2019ve found the research and support that has made the journey worth it.\u201d\n\nThe daughter of Nigerian immigrants, Igbinosun entered the U.S. Navy\u2019s aviation program after completing the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps at the University of Rochester. During flight training, she was on track to fly multi-engine aircraft but received a unique opportunity to pilot C-130 \u201cHercules\u201d military transport planes in the Navy Reserves. The only African-American female pilot on her military base \u2014 and one of the few in her current research area \u2014 she is committed to encouraging young women of color in aviation and STEM fields.\n\nWe recently talked with Igbinosun about her path to engineering and her passion for supporting underrepresented communities in STEM, which she does by volunteering at the UW Women\u2019s Center.\n\nHow did you become interested in aerospace engineering and astrobiology?\n\nAs a kid, I loved science fiction \u2014 it inspired me to wonder if things like interstellar travel and extraterrestrial life could become reality, which led me to pursue science and engineering.\n\nI majored in physics and astronomy in undergrad and then completed a master\u2019s degree in earth and space sciences (ESS) at the UW. Through that experience, I became interested in studying the future of life in the universe, especially human interaction with extraterrestrial environments. When I realized that I wanted to develop sustainable systems to support human missions to other planets, I decided to pursue UW\u2019s A&amp;A program. It was one of the best decisions I ever made and the perfect way to combine my backgrounds in physics, astronomy and planetary science with engineering.\n\nMy adviser, A&amp;A professor Adam Bruckner, is affiliated with UW\u2019s Astrobiology program; in addition to guiding me in my research, he\u2019s supported me through the process of pursuing a dual-title Ph.D. Although several universities offer undergraduate astrobiology courses, the UW is one of the few to offer graduate level training in astrobiology, which takes place through partnerships with affiliated UW doctoral programs, like A&amp;A, ESS, astronomy, oceanography and others.\n\nBefore coming to the UW, you served as a U.S. Navy pilot. How did that experience prepare you for graduate school?\n\nFlight training and graduate level research are very similar. They\u2019re both rigorous, intensive and require perseverance. My time in the Navy taught me a lot \u2014 from developing self-confidence to learning how to deal with adversity \u2014 and was a constant reminder to think beyond perceived limitations, push through insecurities and strive for excellence. Above all, it instilled in me the importance of planning, problem-solving and preparing for the next challenge.\n\nTell us about your current research.\n\nI\u2019m investigating how to extract water from the soil of Mars using high-frequency microwave radiation. My work stems from a desire to understand how we can utilize the indigenous resources of Mars to support human and robotic missions, also known as <i>in-situ <\/i>resource utilization (ISRU). This way, when we start visiting Mars, we won\u2019t need to rely solely on bringing water with us; resources already there can be used to make life support consumables \u2014 oxygen, water and food \u2014 and rocket propellant.\n\nAs far as we know there are no stable sources of liquid water on the surface of Mars, but we expect to find near-surface ice deposits in certain areas. High-frequency microwave radiation doesn\u2019t generate heat as well with ice as it does with components of the soil. So, as the soil is heated, the ices will transition to water vapor. In my work, I seek to understand this interaction and perform experiments to determine how much water we could extract from the subsurface. The fun part is getting to recreate the environment of Mars in the lab and build customized chambers to take measurements.\n\nWhat are your plans after you finish your Ph.D.?\n\nMy dream is to work at NASA\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jpl.nasa.gov\/\">Jet Propulsion Laboratory<\/a>. The research taking place there is the cutting edge of aerospace, and I\u2019d love to develop instrumentation for a planetary mission. I also hope to contribute in developing systems that will support human missions to the moon, Mars and beyond!\n\nIn addition to your academic commitments on campus, you volunteer with <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/womenctr\/making-connections\/\">Making Connections<\/a>. What does that involve?\n\nMaking Connections is a college readiness program through the <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/womenctr\/\">UW Women\u2019s Center<\/a> for high school students from low-income backgrounds who want to pursue STEM fields in higher education. Most of the students are young women of color, first-generation Americans and the first in their families to attend college.\n\nI tutor students in math and help them prep for their SATs. I\u2019ve also given presentations about my experiences as a pilot and an engineer; for example, when the film <i>Hidden Figures<\/i> came out, I joined other women working in aviation and the aerospace industry to talk with students about our educational pathways, challenges and successes.\n\nWhy do you make time to volunteer?\n\nBecause it\u2019s important to encourage young women to do whatever what they want \u2014 whether it\u2019s flying airplanes, becoming engineers, studying planetary science or serving our country. It\u2019s also important to be honest and help them set realistic expectations. The fact is that there are few women in the fields I\u2019ve been in. For women of color, the numbers are even less. And unfortunately this can lead to challenges that can distract us from our goals. In my military experience, for example, it was common to encounter people who had specific ideas of what a woman\u2019s role should be, and generally, those ideas didn\u2019t include piloting aircraft or leading men. As an African-American woman, I often felt that I had to work twice as hard as other women, prove my value and present myself in a way that was more palatable for those around me.\n\nI am so thankful to those who have inspired and supported me along the way. I volunteer because it gives me an opportunity to give back, and hopefully that helps us all move forward."},{"title":"Open access","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/open-access\/","tags":["engineering","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"Airplanes?

Whatever you're into the WOOF 3D Print Club wants to show you how it can benefit from 3D printing.","content":"(College of Engineering, February 2018)\n\nIt\u2019s the second Tuesday of the month, and the WOOF 3D Print Club is buzzing with activity. Students are spread throughout the Mechanical Engineering (ME) building, some attending an introductory workshop in a second-floor classroom and others in the club\u2019s basement workspace, known as the WOOF Room. There, against the steady hum of FDM printers, club members finalize 3D models on their laptops, slicing them into layers before they\u2019re uploaded for printing. A few students compare 3D scans of a Tyrannosaurus Rex tooth fossil. One tweaks a 3D printer that she built from scratch.\n\nAccording to Casi Goodman, a ME senior and one of this year\u2019s club officers, this sort of project diversity is what makes the print club thrive.\n\n\u201cOur members come from many different majors and with a variety of interests, so flexibility and accessibility are key to how WOOF operates,\u201d she explains.\n\nA fast, affordable way to implement ideas, 3D printing can be used to print anything from everyday objects for the home or office to advanced materials, like biomaterials and renewable solar cells. When compared to traditional industrial manufacturing methods, it creates less waste and requires less material to produce complex shapes. It\u2019s a growing technology, one in which students like Goodman see a lot of opportunity.\n\n<b>Creative community<\/b>\n\nEstablished in 2012, the <a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/uw.edu\/woof3d\/home\">Washington Open Objects Fabricators 3D Print Club<\/a> \u2014 WOOF for short \u2014 is a UW student organization focused on advancing 3D printing technologies through education, skills development and project-based work. Housed in ME, the club consists of about 40 members. Although most are engineering students, they believe in the technology\u2019s potential for impact across all disciplines.\n\n\u201c3D printing is an incredibly accessible but underused technology that can be applied to any field,\u201d Goodman says. \u201cOne of our main goals in WOOF is to help others understand its value and how it can enhance their work.\u201d\n\nOriginally known as Fabbers@UW, WOOF was started by three students of ME professor Mark Ganter\u2019s additive manufacturing classes. According to Ganter, who serves as one of WOOF\u2019s faculty advisers, the club has been at the forefront of many big projects since its inception: designing and building the largest student-made 3D printer on campus, 3D printing 3D printers for sustainable manufacturing, even creating the world\u2019s first 3D printed boat, which was raced in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seafair.com\/events\/2017\/seafair-milk-carton-derby\">Seafair\u2019s Milk Carton Derby<\/a>.\n\n\u201cStudent organizations can provide a space for engineering students to set their own course, and that\u2019s certainly been the case with WOOF,\u201d says Ganter. \u201cThere are many 3D printing applications that have yet to be explored, and that\u2019s exciting for students. It encourages them to be creative and playful while also honing their engineering and problem-solving skills.\u201d\n\nIn addition to monthly workshops and talks by industry professionals, the club hosts weekly drop-in hours in the WOOF Room. There, students can ask questions and test new designs and materials on the printers, which range from desktop size to large-scale (the biggest being \u201cBig Blue,\u201d with a 1m x 1m x 1.5m build space). Most all of the printers have been developed in-house, so club members take part in learning how to design, build and maintain them.\n\n<b>Outreach and project-based learning<\/b>\n\nWOOF is committed to outreach, and this year the club has taken on more than a dozen unique projects with campus and community partners. These projects not only illustrate the value of the technology, but they also provide WOOF students with real-world, experiential opportunities to hone their technical, communications and leadership skills.\n\nFor example, WOOF recently started working with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.museumofflight.org\/\">Museum of Flight<\/a> on several projects to enhance museum exhibition display and visitor experience. Some club members are exploring how to replicate the museum\u2019s moon rock \u2014 in terms of size, shape, color and density \u2014 so that visitors can touch the replica to get a sense of how the real moon rock feels, since handling it is not permitted. Others are 3D printing replicas of broken and missing parts to complete a B-29 airplane for exhibition. And a few students are collaborating with museum staff to 3D scan and print small-scale replicas of aircraft and other artifacts for the museum\u2019s guided \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.museumofflight.org\/Plan-Your-Visit\/Tours-and-Experiences\/Sensory-Tours\">Touch the Sky<\/a>\u201d sensory tours so that vision-impaired visitors can experience these objects through touch.\n\nThe club is also partnering with <a href=\"https:\/\/crest.washington.edu\/\">UW Medicine\u2019s Center for Research in Education and Simulation Technologies (CREST)<\/a> to 3D print medical training materials, such as molds for synthetic organ and tissue models. Junior biology major Sierra Simmerman serves as the club\u2019s project coordinator and is involved with the CREST collaboration.\n\n\u201cIf you can scan it, we can print it. That applies to our bodies and the biology fields, too, and one of our projects is to develop a mold for a synthetic human heart from accurate biosynthetic material based on medical scan data from real human hearts,\u201d she explains.\n\nWhen they complete that project, they will start on a detailed replica cross-section of a human arm \u2014 complete with synthetic skin, bones, tendons and arteries.\n\n\u201cWorking with CREST through WOOF has been a great way to combine my interests in 3D printing and biology,\u201d Simmerman adds. \u201cKnowing that we\u2019re creating devices for medical training is really cool, and I can\u2019t wait to start working on the arm.\u201d\n\nSince 2015, WOOF has collaborated with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.burkemuseum.org\/\">Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.engr.washington.edu\/news\/how_to_print_a_mammoth\">3D scan and print replica bones to complete a Columbian Mammoth skeleton<\/a> for the museum to exhibit when it opens its new building in 2019. Club members have also recently started investigating how to 3D print in bronze a replica of a tooth from the Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton unearthed by Burke paleontologists in 2016. Another cluster of students is working with Burke Museum curator Sharlene Santana, who researches how and what bats eat by examining their skulls and jawbones, to 3D print enlarged replicas of bat skulls for better study.\n\nIt\u2019s not common for engineering student clubs to be committed to as many partner projects as WOOF is, and while that has presented some challenges, Goodman says it\u2019s also allowed for some unique opportunities.\n\n\u201cOur work is no longer just about figuring out how to print or how to build printers; it\u2019s become more about how to work across disciplines, listen to and understand our partners\u2019 needs, and manage our time and resources,\u201d she explains.\n\n\u201cIn WOOF we like to think of what we do as \u2018passion-driven engineering\u2019,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe\u2019re passionate about 3D printing and the more we can share that passion with others, the better.\u201d"},{"title":"Inspiring future engineers","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/inspiring-future-engineers\/","tags":["engineering","graduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"As a Clean Energy Institute outreach ambassador, ChemE graduate student Gabriella Tosado is encouraging K-12 students statewide to pursue engineering and science.","content":"(College of Engineering, January 2018)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from Miami, Florida, where climate change isn\u2019t just real; it\u2019s personal,\u201d says chemical engineering graduate student Gabriella Tosado. \u201cMy home city is seriously threatened by rising sea levels, and not only do I want to do my part to develop solutions to help fight climate change, I want to encourage young people \u2014 our next generation of engineers and scientists \u2014 to do the same.\u201d\n\nThe first scientist in her family, Tosado triple-majored in chemistry, environmental science and policy, and religious studies at the University of Miami before switching gears to pursue a dual Ph.D. in chemical engineering and nanotechnology and molecular engineering.

This includes everything from creating curriculum materials and organizing tours to traveling across Washington state to teach K-12 students about clean energy and encourage them to think about going to college to study STEM. I\u2019m proud to say that we\u2019ve reached more than 40,000 students across the state to date.\n\nThrough CEI, I also started working with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pacificsciencecenter.org\/\">Pacific Science Center<\/a>, and this year, I\u2019m serving as a Pacific Science Center Communications Fellow. A few times each quarter, you can find me leading workshops and demonstrations at the Center as part of one of their many public programs, such as Meet a Scientist Day and Paws on Science Research Weekend.\n\nYou are a founding member of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wcheuw.com\/\">Women in Chemical Engineering<\/a> (WChE). Why did this group get started?\n\nChemE assistant professor Elizabeth Nance started this group in 2016 to empower, educate and advocate for women in chemical engineering at all levels \u2014 undergraduates, graduate students, faculty and alums. In a male-dominated field like chemical engineering, I think it\u2019s easy for women to feel invisible. With WChE we wanted to create a welcoming and open space for dialogue, mentorship and collaboration. We host professional development events, industry panels, and as the outreach coordinator, I create community networking and educational outreach opportunities. And we\u2019re always excited to welcome new members! All students, regardless of gender, are encouraged to join and help us advocate for women in our discipline.\n\nThis fall, you organized \u201cIntroduce a Girl to Nano,\u201d a nanotechnology fair to encourage young girls and women toward STEM fields. Tell us about it.\n\nI organized \u201cIntroduce a Girl to Nano\u201d on behalf of CEI and WChE and with help from some fantastic fellow UW students. In celebration of National Nanotechnology Day, our fair featured a variety of hands-on experiments for girls to try. They could react gold nanoparticles, race solar cars, create graphene circuits and rainbow thin film, and so much more! We offered STEM patches to Girl Scouts who participated, which was great fun.\n\nThis event was actually a follow-up to \u201cIntroduce a Girl to Photonics,\u201d a fair I organized for CEI in 2016. That year 50 girls participated; this fall\u2019s event brought in 277. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing that number grow even more next year, though we haven\u2019t decided on the theme yet. We\u2019re considering robotics, coding and polymers, as well as a few others\u2026\n\nA lot of your outreach focuses on introducing underrepresented communities to science and engineering. In your opinion, why is it important to bring more diversity to STEM fields?\n\nI think it\u2019s important for girls and students of color to see women and people of color pursuing STEM disciplines in college. When I was a kid, no one in my immediate family had a background in science, and I didn\u2019t really have any women mentors in science to look up to. So I carved out my own path. I often think about how meaningful it would have been to have someone to look to and say, \u201cShe did this; I can do this, too.\u201d I\u2019m now in a position where I can be that person for someone else, and that\u2019s really motivating.\n\nSpeaking more broadly, engineers and scientists need to come up with solutions to today\u2019s challenges, but to do so effectively, we need to be more creative and diverse in our problem-solving and ways of thinking. We need dynamic solutions in STEM, and the only way to get them is to diversify the field. The more difference, the more opportunity to cultivate and implement new ideas and approaches.\n\nWhy do you make time for outreach?\n\nOutreach keeps me sane! In graduate school, there are many failures. You design, you test, and more often than not, you fail. So you start again. There\u2019s a lot of stress.\n\nBut in outreach there\u2019s so much wonder and excitement; it\u2019s infectious and promising! The smiles on kids\u2019 faces when they test out solar spinners they\u2019ve just made, or when they realize they can make a battery from scratch \u2014 those moments are awesome. And I can\u2019t tell you how much it brightens my day to see a bunch of little girls line up to race solar cars. That\u2019s the best!"},{"title":"Helping the dogs in our world","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/helping-the-dogs-in-our-world\/","tags":["continuum-college","pce"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"Adam Winston wanted to turn his love for canines into a career.

If it wasn\u2019t for the certificate program, I don\u2019t think some of those doors would have opened up for me.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s already produced 12 episodes of the show, which has listeners from all 50 states and a variety of foreign countries, including Japan, Canada and Australia.\n\n<b>CHARTING A CAREER PATH<\/b>\n\nThe certificate experience allowed Adam to develop a new career in the field.

As a medical student he\u2019d met with patients before, but this time he couldn\u2019t decipher what the patient was trying to say. She was unable to communicate clearly because of aphasia, a communication disorder that makes word-finding difficult. Both doctor and patient were frustrated \u2014 until Jason remembered strategies he\u2019d learned in a training session about communication disorders.\n\nThe Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences (SPHSC) offers training to UW medical students each year to improve their interactions with patients with communication disorders. During the two-hour session, the medical students have opportunities to practice what they learn, with Speech and Hearing Sciences students role-playing as patients. About 150 medical students and 25 SPHSC students participate each year.\n\n\u201cWe knew we wanted to give the medical students interactions with patients who struggle to communicate,\u201d says\u00a0SPHSC\u00a0lecturer Michael Burns, who leads the training with Carolyn Baylor,\u00a0adjunct associate professor of SPHSC and associate professor of rehabilitation medicine. \u201cWe realized we have an army of students in our department who are learning all about these communication problems, so we now train them to take on the role of the patient.\u201d\n\nThe\u00a0SPHSC\u00a0students enroll in a one-credit course, Patient-Provider Communication, that not only trains them for their role as patients but explores communication issues in medical settings and the role of speech-language pathologists in addressing them. It\u2019s a topic Burns knows well. He spent years working\u00a0 as a speech-language pathologist in medical settings, witnessing poor interactions between patients with communication disorders and their providers. For his dissertation research, he interviewed doctors, patients with communication problems, and their family members about the challenges they face.\n\nSPHSC\u2019s medical student training focuses on two common disorders, often caused by a stroke: aphasia, a word-finding problem,\u00a0and\u00a0dysarthria, a weakness in many of the muscles involved in speech. Each disorder presents unique challenges. Patients with\u00a0dysarthria\u00a0are often able to find the right words but can\u2019t speak clearly, so offering a white board, a pen and pad, or a sheet with the alphabet can make all the difference. But that approach won\u2019t necessarily help patients with aphasia, who typically struggle to find words whether they are speaking or writing. For them, it\u2019s best to avoid open-ended questions that make answering difficult. Instead, simplifying questions or using a sheet with medically related pictures can be helpful, enabling the patient to point to the pertinent image, such as a pill bottle if the concern is medication.\n\nThat sounds simple enough, but identifying a communication problem and devising an appropriate solution can take practice. Burns spends 30 minutes talking to the medical students about strategies, which they then use in the role-play exercises. \u201cThat\u2019s the most powerful piece,\u201d Burns says. \u201cWe give them a ton of tools and they often say \u2018Yeah, I get this, it\u2019s easy,\u2019 but when we put them in front of one of our\u00a0SPHSC\u00a0students trained to struggle to communicate, they typically freeze. They initially can\u2019t figure out what they\u2019re supposed to do. It happens every time. They often find out that it\u2019s harder than they thought.\u201d\n\nThe students participate in two or three role-play scenarios. Each time, the medical students have ten minutes to figure out the patient\u2019s current health concerns. \u00a0The experience is eye-opening \u2014 not only for the medical students, but also for the\u00a0SPHSC\u00a0\u201cpatients\u201d who experience the frustration of not being understood.\n\n\u201cPatients typically know what they want to say,\u201d says Burns, \u201cbut sometimes the doctor just\u00a0isn\u2019t unlocking the right pathway to let them do that. Our students get to experience that.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the training, students shed their roles to gather for a debrief. The medical students share what was difficult and what got easier; the\u00a0SPHSC\u00a0students offer feedback and suggestions based on their observations as patients. \u201cI always tell our Speech and Hearing students that they often know \u00a0more about this topic than medical students do, and that they have valuable advice to give,\u201d Burns says. \u201cThis training helps them see that.\u201d\n\nWhile patient-provider communication training occurs in nearly all medical schools, few are discussing and including patients with communication disorders. Burns and Baylor hope to share their approach with medical schools in the U.S. and abroad through an online module they are developing. They know that awareness of communication issues can greatly improve the healthcare experience for patients.\n\n\u201cIf doctors take the first few minutes to figure out how a patient communicates, the rest typically will go much easier,\u201d Burns say. \u201cAs long as they recognize there\u2019s a problem and try to address it, that\u2019s all their patients are looking for. Patients don\u2019t expect doctors to be perfect at this. But to ignore the problem and pretend it\u2019s not happening \u2014 that\u2019s not going to work. You have to do something different.\u201d"},{"title":"Inspire by ives","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/inspire-by-ives\/","tags":["arts-sciences","faculty"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"UW composer Huck Hodge talks about his music and receiving the prestigious Charles Ives Living Award.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, April 2018)\n\nAs a beginning clarinetist in grade school, Huck Hodge added a twist to a Bach minuet performed by the class. At the end of each musical phrase, he added his own elaboration to Bach\u2019s composition.\n\n\u201cThe teacher asked why I was doing that,\u201d recalls Hodge, associate professor in the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/music.washington.edu\/\">UW School of Music<\/a>. \u201cI thought, \u2018Why\u00a0<i>wouldn\u2019t<\/i>\u00a0I do that?\u2019\u201d\n\nHodge continues to ask that question. Now an accomplished composer, he recently received the largest monetary award for American composers, the Charles Ives Living Award in Music. Presented by the American Academy of Arts and Letters (AAAL), the award includes a $200,000 prize and the stipulation that the composer forego all salaried employment during the two-year award period.\n\n\u201cHaving a full two years dedicated to composing is exciting, but also a bit daunting,\u201d says Hodge. \u201cI might try to do a couple of larger-scale projects, maybe branch off in directions I haven\u2019t gone in before.\u201d\n\nHodge\u2019s body of work is already tremendously diverse. Since writing his first composition for bicycle horn at age eight or nine, he has composed solo pieces and symphonies, pieces with electronics, and collaborative works involving video and dance. His music has been performed at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, Seattle\u2019s Benaroya Hall, and numerous music festivals, with a different creative process for each piece.\n\n\u201cSometimes I have a pretty strong concept in mind,\u201d Hodge says. \u201cIt\u2019s not even necessarily a musical concept. It may be a response to a poetic idea or some really sublime experience in the natural world. I usually try to come to an understanding of the underlying structure of the experience that can be translated into music.\u201d\n\nSo what can one expect of a Huck Hodge composition?\u00a0AAAL\u00a0president\u00a0Yehudi\u00a0Wyner\u00a0describes Hodge as \u201ca brilliant colorist and creator of gorgeous, lyrical soundscapes.\u201d Hodge welcomes that description, with a caveat: the lyricism in his work may not be what people expect.\n\n\u201cUsually when we use the word \u2018lyrical\u2019 to describe music, it entails sweeping lines, effusive gestures, and full-on emotive action,\u201d explains Hodge. \u201cThere\u2019s a somewhat shallow, unreflective self-confidence about it. But my music is never lyrical in that way. There\u2019s always something about the lyricism that\u2019s just on the threshold of breaking, of collapsing.\u201d Hodge offers the example of a broad sweeping line held slightly too long, affecting the listener\u2019s ability to hear it as a continuous melody. Or sustained tones with glitches or breaks, as if the tones are disintegrating within the lyricism.\n\nHodge sometimes includes familiar elements in his compositions to enhance the tension and the potential for discovery. For listeners who find this brand of music challenging, those familiar elements can make his compositions more accessible. But Hodge encourages audiences to approach all new music with a sense of adventure, a willingness to sit with the unfamiliar.\n\n\u201cIn a way, unfamiliarity is the whole essence of contemporary classical music,\u201d Hodge says. \u201cThis is an approach to music that typically questions complacency.\u00a0But if the music you write is completely unfamiliar or alienating to others, that could be just another form of complacency. The real insight is in the way music can cast the familiar in an unfamiliar context, so that the things that are familiar become uncertain.\u201d\n\nHodge points to his award\u2019s namesake Charles Ives as a master of this, always introducing ingenious and original concepts in his compositions. Hodge notes that Ives\u00a0\u2014\u00a0often considered the greatest composer in American classical music history\u00a0\u2014\u00a0was not taken seriously for most of his life. Only after winning a Pulitzer Prize\u00a0shortly before his death\u00a0was his\u00a0music performed regularly. The m\u00ad\u00adoney\u00a0for the Charles Ives Living Award comes directly from royalties paid for performances of Ives' work, donated by his\u00a0wife.\n\n\u201cReceiving the award is a huge honor, but for me mostly because of the legacy of Charles Ives,\u201d says Hodge. \u201cI hope that I can return even a little of the generosity in the music that I write. It\u2019s good to have my name out there, but for me, it\u2019s more important to use the opportunity to give something back in my music.\u201d"},{"title":"A research lab in the performing arts","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/a-research-lab-in-the-performing-arts\/","tags":["alumni","faculty","graduate-student","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Visiting artists are immersed in creative research at the UW through an interdisciplinary initiative.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, March 2018)\n\nArgentinian choreographer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.margaritabali.com\/\">Margarita Bali <\/a>has spent months thinking about Seattle\u2019s stairs.

That makes this very different than other types of grant support.\u201d\n\nAll the UW performing arts units are involved in this initiative. Since spring 2016, they have welcomed a diverse group of fellows, from playwrights to composers to performance artists to choreographers, with visits ranging from ten days to several months or longer. Fellows sometimes teach workshops, discuss their creative process in public forums, and collaborate with faculty and students during their visits\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but only if they choose to.

During a visit to San Juan Island\u2019s False Bay, which transforms to a mudflat at low tide, Swalla pointed out how mud patches just ten feet apart can vary in color and texture and host different animal communities. \u201cStudents got a sense of Billie\u2019s intimate knowledge of the space,\u201d says Woelfle-Erskine. \u201cShe spoke for just about 45 minutes, but it really set the context for the students, who then spent hours watching the tide empty completely over the course of the morning.\u201d\n\nAs the tide receded, the students wrote in field journals \u2014 as they did every morning during field trips and again before a late-afternoon seminar. Sometimes they wrote in response to site-related prompts posed by Hazard and Woelfle-Erskine; other times the writing was inspired by their surroundings. \u201cField writing is a tradition across so many disciplines,\u201d says Hazard, who has graduate degrees in both environmental studies and poetry. \u201cWe wanted students from many backgrounds to feel like writing was part of their specialty already and they were just expanding it\u00a0\u2014 learning different approaches, different ways of paying attention.\u201d\n\nIn the evening, the class gathered to share their day\u2019s writing. For some, that took getting used to.\u00a0 \u201cAt first I felt like I had to write a specific way,\u201d says physics major Alex McGoldrick, an Interdisciplinary Honors student. \u201cOver time, I eased into writing in a style more akin to myself and relaxed a lot more. I would get these random ideas and would immediately pull out my journal to write a full passage or sketch a particular sight. For me, following these random tangents produced the best writing.\u201d\n\nKoehlinger, who normally tends toward academic or scientific writing, welcomed the opportunity to write without constraints. \u201cApproaching writing from a more creative and less structured way was a great way to get out of my head,\u201d she says. \u201cAs a scientist, I\u2019m also searching for new ways to communicate with non-scientists. I think that scientists need to embrace more out-of-the-box thinking and incorporation of creative processes.\u201d\n\nAll fifteen students from the field intensive, plus six additional students, are now in the spring quarter seminar, where they are continuing to explore themes introduced in the field. Their readings range from poetry to historical and scientific documents, and they continue to visit shorelines \u2014 this time at the edge of campus\u00a0\u2014\u00a0for field writing. Guest speakers\u00a0include\u00a0a recent Washington State poet laureate, an orca researcher at NOAA, and a scientist affiliated with the Waterlines Project, who offer perspectives as diverse as those of the students.\n\nWell, almost as diverse.\n\n\u201cWith this group, we have such a wide range of lenses through which we view nature,\u201d says Kayla Carrington, a fourth-year undergraduate majoring in Community, Environment &amp; Planning (CEP), and Environmental Studies, Honors. \u201cSome students are science and research focused, some see landscapes through the lens of indigenous history, while some contemplate psychology and philosophy. It really is illuminating to see how different minds perceive and articulate the environments around them. When we put these perspectives into conversation, we are challenged to broaden our own.\u201d"},{"title":"A Spanish language film festival, curated for teens","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/a-spanish-language-film-festival-curated-for-teens\/","tags":["arts-sciences","faculty","graduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"Spanish studies graduate students are planning a Spanish-language film festival for Chief Health High School.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, April 2018)\n\nArgentinian choreographer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.margaritabali.com\/\">Margarita Bali <\/a>has spent months thinking about Seattle\u2019s stairs. The elegant stairs in UW\u2019s Suzzallo Library. The bold central staircase in Odegaard Undergraduate Library. The concrete steps in downtown Seattle\u2019s Freeway Park.\u00a0 As a visiting artist at the UW through mid-April, Bali is collaborating with students, faculty, alumni, and community dancers on a work that features stairs as a way to explore physical movement in diverse settings.\n\nBali is one of more than a dozen artists from around the world immersed in creative research at the UW through the <a href=\"https:\/\/meanycenter.org\/engage\/creative-fellowships-initiative\">Creative Fellowships Initiative<\/a>, a program funded through a three-year, $750,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The initiative is spearheaded by the UW\u2019s Meany Center for the Performing Arts.\n\n\u201cThis initiative focuses on process, not product,\u201d says Michelle Witt, executive and artistic director of Meany Center, who co-leads the initiative with Todd London, executive director of the School of Drama. \u201cIf the byproduct of a fellow\u2019s process is a new work, that\u2019s fabulous, but they are not required to develop any kind of final product. That makes this very different than other types of grant support.\u201d\n\nAll the UW performing arts units are involved in this initiative. Since spring 2016, they have welcomed a diverse group of fellows, from playwrights to composers to performance artists to choreographers, with visits ranging from ten days to several months or longer. Fellows sometimes teach workshops, discuss their creative process in public forums, and collaborate with faculty and students during their visits\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but only if they choose to. Their approaches to the fellowship are as varied as their creative work.\n\nThe <a href=\"http:\/\/jackquartet.com\/\">JACK Quartet<\/a>, a string quartet committed to contemporary music, is midway through its residency, with six campus visits scheduled over three years. Drawn to the UW by the innovative work being done by <a href=\"https:\/\/dxarts.washington.edu\/\">DXARTS <\/a>and <a href=\"https:\/\/music.washington.edu\/\">School of Music<\/a> faculty in the area of experimental\u00a0music, the quartet is collaborating with Professors Richard Karpen and Juan Pampin to create and perform music that incorporates live electronics manipulated by brainwaves and arm motions. The collaboration involves experimentation, collection of\u00a0data, and the design of\u00a0an interactive electronic musical instrument, all using cutting-edge technology developed at the UW.\n\n\u201cExperimental work involves quite a bit of trial and error,\u201d says JACK Quartet\u2019s John Richards. \u201cThis residency provides the time and space necessary to fully develop these ideas into dependable and usable musical devices that artists can use in the live performance.\u201d The residency will culminate with a concert-length work for string quartet and electronics in 2019, with the audience engulfed in sounds controlled by the live actions and brainwaves of the quartet on stage.\n\nDustin\u00a0Chinn, a playwright with <a href=\"http:\/\/ma-yitheatre.org\/about-the-lab\/\">Ma-Yi Theater Writers Lab<\/a>, spent his month-long residency hanging out with a non-arts crowd. He traveled to the UW\u2019s Friday Harbor Lab in the San Juan Islands, where he met with marine scientists to gather information for a play he\u2019s writing about Herschel, a nickname given to the sea lions who became famous for preying on Washington\u2019s endangered steelhead trout.\n\n\u201cThe process gave me a much-needed historical and scientific perspective on the events the play is based upon,\u201d says\u00a0Chinn. \u201cIt also gave me firsthand contact with scientists, and a notion of how they talk, think, and how they might want to be represented in a fictional context.\u201d\u00a0Chinn\u00a0presented a reading of his play-in-progress during a public event at the School of Drama.\n\nFor choreographer Bali, the opportunity to immerse herself in creative work for three months, away from her home in Argentina, has been a huge plus. \u201cI\u2019ve been able to give all my attention to the work,\u201d she says. \u201cTotal focus. It\u2019s an opportunity to do something unusual, and I\u2019m thankful for that.\u201d Bali is creating a\u00a0videodance\u2014a dance choreographed to be filmed rather than performed on stage\u2014that will feature faculty, students, and community dancers on stairs that curve, lead nowhere, or overlap with a mind-bending nod to artist M.C. Escher. She also is teaching a UW course on technology and dance, which has attracted students from physics, math, and drama as well as dance.\n\nThe public can attend a work-in-progress presentation of Bali\u2019s videodance on April 3, followed by a discussion with the artist. Also this spring, Mellon fellows\u00a0Nguy\u1ec5n Thanh Th\u1ee7y and\u00a0Ng\u00f4 Tr\u00e0 My from Vietnam,\u00a0Stefan \u00d6stersj\u00f6 from Sweden, and\u00a0Garth Knox from France join long-time artistic partner Karpen in the performance of two new musical works collaboratively created for the one-of-a-kind Harry Partch instrument collection at the School of Music.\u00a0Previous initiative projects have included a new piece by dance company BANDALOOP, performed at Meany Center in October 2017. \u201cIt was the world premiere, and the piece will now have an international life,\u201d says Witt. \u201cThe residency allowed BANDALOOP to break into a completely new type of work.\u201d\n\nNot all fellows present their work or lead workshops, but they all inspire students through their presence and their creative process. \u201cThey all work in different ways, and they model for students the ambition, imagination, and artistic freedom that are part of research in the arts,\u201d says London. \u201cThe Creative Fellowships Initiative is trying to create a semblance of a research laboratory by giving the fellows space and time and some resources in a way that only a large research university can.\u201d\n\nAnd this is only the beginning, adds Witt. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to continue to build and grow this initiative,\u201d she says. \u201cArtists have so much to teach us about innovation and creativity.\u201d"},{"title":"Learning happiness","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/learning-happiness\/","tags":["arts-sciences","faculty","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"A new psychology course pairs scientific research on happiness with activities that promote a positive outlook.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, March 8, 2018)\n\nWe all want to be happy. If only there were a course for that.\n\nAt the UW, there is.\n\nTabitha Kirkland, lecturer in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.psych.uw.edu\/\">Department of Psychology<\/a>, offers PSYCH 448: Happiness, which combines scientific research on happiness with activities that have been shown to have a positive impact.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about happiness, we\u2019re not talking about it as an emotion,\u201d explains Kirkland, a social psychologist whose dissertation on happiness was grounded in social cognitive neuroscience. \u201cWhen we\u2019re looking at happiness in this class, we\u2019re thinking about it more as an enduring state, beyond temporary emotion or mood. It\u2019s more about whether one\u2019s orientation toward the world is more positive or negative.\u201d\n\nWeekly lectures and discussions of scientific readings are supplemented with hands-on activities, films, and guest speakers. Offered for the first time this quarter, the course quickly filled with psychology majors. Kirkland hopes to open the class to non-majors in the future, with a limit of 50 students. \u201cThe smaller the learning environment, the deeper we can go and the more the students feel a sense of community in the class,\u201d she says.\n\nSenior Rayanna Acia signed up for Happiness because she was \u201ctired of being in a constant state of negativity\u201d and hoped the class would change her perspective. She believes the course content and assignments have had a remarkable effect. \u201cI find myself leaving the negativity behind and becoming happier each day,\u201d Acia says. \u201cI don\u2019t even remember the last time I\u2019ve felt this happy so consistently.\u201d\n\nIf that sounds like magic, Kirkland insists it is not. People <i>can<\/i> become happier if they put in the work, she says. <a href=\"http:\/\/stat.psych.uiuc.edu\/~ediener\/Documents\/Diener-Suh-Lucas-Smith_1999.pdf\">Studies<\/a> suggest\u00a0that 50\u00a0percent\u00a0of one\u2019s potential for happiness is attributable to genetics and 10\u00a0percent\u00a0is the result of external circumstances. The remaining 40 percent can be influenced by how we choose to approach situations. \u201cThe fact that we can increase our own happiness is the toughest thing for people to wrap their minds around,\u201d says Kirkland. \u201cWhile people have an individual set point for happiness, they can move from that set point with intentional practice.\u201d\n\nSo what can nudge us higher on the happiness scale? In her book <i>The How of Happiness<\/i>, research psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky suggests a variety of practices that may help: savoring small pleasures, random acts of kindness, positive reframing, meditation, yoga, and more. Kirkland, who assigns the book for class, has each student pursue one of the practices all quarter, and introduces additional happiness habits to try in and out of class each week.\n\n\u201cThe actual doing of activities is tough for a lot of students,\u201d says Cameron McCann, a peer advisor for the course. \u201cSome of the activities may seem corny or be things that people will find awkward. But the class\u00a0isn\u2019t just something that is taught out of a book focused on rote memorization. It encompasses knowledge and practice. I think the most challenging thing for students regarding a happiness practice is\u2026practice!\u201d\n\nMcCann, a UW psychology major, speaks from firsthand experience. He took an earlier version of the course, taught by Kirkland at Bellevue College before she joined the UW faculty. McCann continues to practice mindful meditation on a daily basis and has kept up with other practices he learned in class. \u201cExpressing gratitude is an important practice in my life, and arguably my favorite,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve come to learn that searching for the good in things is intrinsically rewarding, and when found and shared, profound things happen.\u201d\n\nOf course each student responds to different practices. A favorite for Acia was a class assignment to monitor one\u2019s use of technology for three days, with one day designated as a technology blackout day. While most students found it impossible to give up their phones, television, and other devices, Acia was resolute. \u201cI ended up doing the technology blackout day for four days,\u201d she says. \u201cI also ended up deleting almost all my social media apps, stopped checking my email and texts as soon as they arrive, and stopped taking pictures of everything. \u2026Because I\u2019m no longer taking daily pictures for my Instagram account or scrolling through social media accounts, I have more time to do what I thought I didn\u2019t have time to do.\u201d\n\nFor another student, yoga was a revelation. When he learned that the class would attend a yoga session, he was unsure what to expect and nervous about keeping up. Writing about the yoga experience after the fact, the student shared that he was on a mind and body high the rest of the day. \u201cHe wrote that it\u2019s the happiest he\u2019s ever been,\u201d recalls Kirkland. \u201cThat was really cool to read.\u201d\n\nDespite the benefits of the activities introduced in class, Kirkland admits it took her a while to practice what she preached. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between being academically interested in something and personally applying it,\u201d she says. \u201cI talked about mindfulness for about five years before I tried it myself. In the last year or two, it\u2019s become a much more intentional search and inquiry for me. Now I think about it a lot, and I think it improves my teaching on the subject.\u201d\n\nKirkland won\u2019t say whether she\u2019s happier as a result. But Acia offers an unequivocal endorsement. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for being able to attend this class,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m definitely much happier than before the quarter began.\u201d"},{"title":"A quantum leap","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/a-quantum-leap\/","tags":["arts-sciences","graduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"A physics student explores the possibilities of quantum computing \u2014 with help from a Microsoft Research Fellowship.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, March 2018)\n\nUW doctoral student Natalie Klco was curious about quantum computing, so she enrolled in a graduate course in the <a href=\"https:\/\/sharepoint.washington.edu\/phys\/Pages\/default.aspx\">Physics Department <\/a>about the emerging field. Less than two years later, she\u2019s at the forefront of quantum computing research, and the first recipient of a competitive two-year Microsoft Research Fellowship in quantum computing.\n\n\u201cIt was an experimental physics course (offered by Boris Blinov), which was a shift for me,\u201d says Klco. \u201cWhen I started, I had no idea how to ask a quantum computer anything or get it to calculate anything meaningful. But I found it really intriguing because quantum computing makes you think about your calculations very differently than programming a classical computer.\u201d\n\nQuantum computing is a new and growing field that tech companies and government entities are interested in developing. Classical computers use bits with values of 0 or 1, but quantum computers store information on quantum bits, or qubits. \u201cQubits can be a combination of 0 and 1 at the same time, just like Schr\u00f6dinger's famous cat can be alive and dead at the same time,\u201d explains David Kaplan, professor of physics and senior fellow at the UW\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.int.washington.edu\/\">Institute for Nuclear Theory <\/a>(INT). \u201cAs a result, quantum computers will in principle perform some calculations far more quickly than classical computers.\u201d Physicists are playing a key role in the development of quantum computers, both in designing physical qubits and in developing algorithms for their future use.\n\nThere\u2019s much to learn before quantum computing will be viable for most applications, which is why Microsoft chose Klco for a research fellowship. As Klco continues to work toward her PhD in physics and study quantum field theory at INT, the fellowship will enable her to work closely with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/research\/\">Microsoft Research<\/a>, which has one of the leading programs for developing algorithms for quantum computers. It\u2019s an opportunity to be a part of determining what the field of quantum computing will look like in the future.\n\nThose who know Klco were not surprised when the fellowship was announced. After taking her first quantum computing class, Klco was so driven to understand the basics that she spent her winter break teaching herself quantum programing using IBM\u2019s cloud-hosted quantum computer, Quantum Experience. \u201cIt was silly,\u201d laughs Klco, describing the program she created based on calculating non-trivial probabilities, similar to a game of chance. \u201cBut it worked! I\u2019ve come a long way since then, but it was my first quantum program and I learned a lot from it.\u201d\n\nNatalie\u2019s curiosity inspired UW faculty as well. \u201cShe is exceptional in many regards,\u201d says Martin Savage, professor of physics and Klco\u2019s advisor at INT. \u201cIn addition to being a talented junior scientist, Natalie taught herself quantum computing and was running programs on the IBM quantum computing hardware before any faculty in the Physics Department had written a program to run on any quantum computer, and before most of us had seriously considered the potential of such capabilities for scientific applications. I have to admit that her interests and advancement in quantum computing gave me and others a strong push in the right direction.\u201d\n\nThe work Klco and collaborators are doing in quantum field theory at INT is cutting-edge and promising, though like many new technologies, it is hard to foresee what the impact over time will be. Savage believes this work will play a major role in the future of developing algorithms, which are at the heart of quantum computing. \u201cNew algorithms tend to have broad applicability, and there is every reason to believe that will also be true for algorithms emerging from Natalie\u2019s research,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Microsoft Research Fellowship is one piece of a growing partnership between members of the UW Department of Physics and Microsoft Research. UW has a pool of talented faculty and students interested in quantum computing, and Microsoft is creating infrastructure to develop this technology, bringing together researchers from disciplines including physics, mathematics, engineering, chemistry, and computer science.\n\nEven as major tech companies like Microsoft and government entities like the Department of Energy are investing time and money into quantum computing, one thing is clear:\u00a0the field is still in its infancy.\n\n\u201cI think it is important to brainstorm about what might be possible,\u201d says Klco. \u201cAt this early stage, quantum computers are in the process of being built. If we have an idea of what we want to use the computers for, then we can build the architecture and change the fundamentals of quantum computing to fit those needs.\u201d\n\nAs for the future, Klco is hesitant to make predictions. The possibilities are enormous, but so is the learning curve.\n\n\"Even with the exciting progress that can be expected over the next ten years,\" she says, \"we may still find ourselves at the very beginning of discovering the capabilities of quantum computers.\""},{"title":"Learning from the ground up","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/learning-from-the-ground-up\/","tags":["college-of-the-environment","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"At the College of the Environment's geology field camp, students hit the dirt for lessons you can't find in a textbook.","content":"(UW Homepage, April 2018)\n\nAt just past 2 p.m. in early July, the temperature in southwestern Montana is hovering around 93 degrees.\n\nImpervious to the heat, Michael McGroder climbs swiftly up a steep, rocky hill where a group of geology students and teaching assistants from the University of Washington stand observing two small ridges below.\n\nIt\u2019s their fourth day at Block Mountain, just outside the town of Dillon, and the students are trying to map an area known informally as the Rat\u2019s Nest. The name is well earned by this giant tangle of rocks: The oldest layers are somehow on top of younger layers, some layers are upside down, and the <i>entire<\/i> Triassic period (the layer that formed between 251 million and 199 million years ago) is missing in places.\n\n\u201cGeologists love a good murder mystery,\u201d says McGroder, the group\u2019s instructor \u2014 and making sense of geologic complexities is akin to tracking down the culprit.\n\nOver six weeks, his students tried out their detective skills by mapping, surveying and exploring this slice of Big Sky Country as part of the Department of Earth and Space Sciences\u2019 geology field camp. For many of them, it was their first opportunity to practice geology like a professional would.\n\nA LANDSCAPE MADE FOR LEARNING\n\nUW students have been coming to field camp in Dillon for 25 years \u2014 and they\u2019re not alone. Mud-splattered vans with license plates from West Virginia, Texas and Georgia attest to the area\u2019s widespread draw.\n\nWhat brings people here? In this area, erosion has laid bare an astounding 3.2 billion years of Earth history, giving students the opportunity to cut their teeth in geologic settings they\u2019ve only read about before.\n\n\u201cIn the classroom, everything is much more black-and-white,\u201d says field camp participant Ruslan Pavlenko, \u201917. \u201cWhereas here, it\u2019s all right in front of you, and you\u2019re able to see the bigger picture.\u201d\n\nDuring camp, the UW students work on mapping projects that take them from Dillon in the south to Glacier National Park in the north. Arguably the hardest work is at Block Mountain, where they spend six eight-hour days mapping the large site, including the Rat\u2019s Nest.\n\nBlock Mountain and other areas around Dillon are special for another reason, too: Over the years, geology field camp instructors have honored an informal \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d to never publish research on the sites, explains McGroder. This has left them spoiler-proof for questing students \u2014 a true rarity in the digital age.\n\nGIVING BACK BY GOING OUTSIDE\n\nMcGroder has overseen field camp since 2016, but he\u2019d been to Dillon long before: As a master\u2019s candidate at the University of Montana, he was a TA for a field camp in the area and was impressed by its learning opportunities.\n\nHe went on to a Ph.D. program in geology at the UW, with Professors Emeritus Jody Bourgeois and Darrel Cowan (who led field camp for its first 23 years) as his advisers.\n\nAfter earning his Ph.D. in 1988, McGroder spent a long career at ExxonMobil. When he retired a few years ago, he sought a way to give back beyond financial support by sharing his industry knowledge with geology students. When he ran into Cowan at a conference, his former adviser suggested that McGroder try his hand as field camp leader.\n\nWhile it\u2019s clear that McGroder makes a lasting impact on his students, being around them has changed him as well. \u201cIt\u2019s energizing for me to think back to when I was that age and had epiphanies about what I wanted to do for a career in geoscience,\u201d he says.\n\nMcGroder\u2019s teaching style has also resonated with the group. \u201cMike was very hands-off,\u201d says UW senior Allison Nelson. \u201cBut if you asked a question, he\u2019d be very detailed and point you in the right direction. It was great.\u201d\n\nPRESERVING FIELD CAMP FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS\n\nAcross the country, field camps are disappearing or consolidating \u2014 many factors, including the growth of remote-sensing mapping strategies and the rise of lab-based technologies, have played a role in this shift. The UW is one of the few remaining universities to operate its own program, which means that securing funding is more crucial than ever.\n\nWithout the field camp experience, students would miss out on essential knowledge, techniques and personal growth that can set them up for success. \u201cThey gain so many skills beyond simply learning to make maps \u2014 skills that come only from spending six weeks out here,\u201d says McGroder. He particularly hopes that they build scientific confidence and learn about science communication, as students who wish to pursue a career in geology need to be able to tell the public about their work in a way that non-geologists can understand.\n\nNelson experienced several a-ha moments during her time at field camp. \u201cYou climb on top of a ridge, and it clicks,\u201d she says. \u201cSuddenly all the rock formations you\u2019ve put on your map make sense, and you can actually figure it out.\u201d\n\nIn her final year at the UW, Nelson plans to take classes that expand the knowledge she gained during field camp, and she\u2019d like to continue with geology after graduation. Many other camp participants also intend to pursue careers in the field.\n\n\u201cWhen they come to camp, they\u2019re geology students,\u201d McGroder says. \u201cWhen they leave, they\u2019re geologists.\u201dW"},{"title":"Building bridges","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/building-bridges\/","tags":["arts-sciences","giving","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"From a small Washington town to one of the world's largest cities, Caleb Huffman is on a quest to connect with others \u2014 and expand his own perspective in the process.","content":"(UW Homepage, May 2018)\n\nCaleb Huffman, \u201918, admits that his transition to the University of Washington was daunting.

The faith-based organization\u2019s tagline is \u201cPursuing Truth Together,\u201d and as a Christian, Huffman enjoyed engaging with people from different belief systems to discuss some of life\u2019s most difficult questions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not omniscient as humans,\u201d he says. \u201cThe information we\u2019ve processed only gives us a certain slice of the world, which is inherently going to be limited.\u201d\n\nAfter his first year at the UW, Huffman pushed himself even further by traveling outside the U.S. for the first time. He went to Rome with the support of a grant from the U.S. Department of State, which he learned about through the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/uaa\/excelling\/office-of-merit-scholarships-fellowships-and-awards\/\">UW Office of Merit Scholarships, Fellowships and Awards<\/a> (OMSFA). In addition to studying global cities and human migrations, he volunteered at a refugee center.\n\n\u201cI met a lot of political refugees, and their stories were just heartbreaking,\u201d he says. \u201cI got really interested in international relations after that.\u201d\n\n<b>A global community<\/b>\n\nIn his sophomore year, Huffman was accepted into the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/globalaffairs\/hpa\/\">Husky Presidential Ambassadors Leadership Institute<\/a>, which matches current UW students with incoming first-year students from China to develop cross-cultural communication and leadership skills. After a week of leadership prep on campus, Huffman spent two weeks with his cohort at Tsinghua University in Beijing, where they studied alongside newly admitted UW international students who would be moving to Seattle in the fall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really easy for international students to remain in their communities at the UW,\u201d says Huffman. \u201cSome study abroad in the United States, but they never truly \u2018leave\u2019 their country. This program is trying to bridge that divide.\u201d\n\nHuffman\u2019s growing interest in U.S.\u2013China relations made him want to return and keep learning. With more help from OMSFA, he was selected to participate in two international bridge-building programs with conferences in the U.S. and China. He spent part of last summer in Chengdu, improving his Mandarin and learning more about China\u2019s culture. And he\u2019s involved in the Gorton Center Global Leaders Program through the National Bureau of Asian Research, focusing on policy and business leadership.\n\n\u201cHumans are similar in a lot of ways, but our differences are there \u2014 and sometimes you can\u2019t see them,\u201d Huffman says. \u201cThat matters because when you\u2019re making policy, if you don\u2019t know about those differences, you might hurt people.\u201d\n\n<b>The next stage of the journey<\/b>\n\nUltimately, Huffman hopes to become a lawyer, working in the U.S. legal system to help strengthen our country\u2019s relationship with China and contribute to a more peaceful world. But first he\u2019s heading back to China for graduate school to deepen his understanding of its legal system.\n\n\u201cThe U.S.\u2013China relationship will be the most critical bilateral relationship of my lifetime. How we will shape each other\u2019s, and the world\u2019s, international norms is a question of utmost importance,\u201d says Huffman.\n\nAs he prepares to move to a place that differs dramatically from Seattle in size and culture, Huffman recalls a time when he was nervous about coming to the UW. \u201cNow that seems kind of silly to me, because you can find your community anywhere. There are seven billion people in the world. What community are you going to find? Where are you going to go?\u201d"},{"title":"Speaking words of justice","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/speaking-words-of-justice\/","tags":["undergraduate-student","bothell"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Through her undergraduate research, UW Bothell senior Malak Shalabi is exploring her identity, her past \u2014 and the grim political reality that still affects her family.","content":"(UW Homepage, April 2018)\n\nWhen Malak Shalabi visits her extended family in Jordan, they sometimes drive through the countryside and see Syria in the distance. \u201cBut there\u2019s no going back,\u201d she says. \u201cWhenever I spend time with my family and they share stories of life back home, I hold on to every word, because this is one of the closest connections I\u2019ll ever have to our motherland.\u201d\n\nShalabi\u2019s family are refugees scattered throughout the Middle East and the U.S. Her father\u2019s father was born in Palestine but moved to Qatar in 1958. Born in Syria, Shalabi\u2019s mother immigrated to Kuwait with her family during the presidency of Hafez al-Assad. She was visiting her brothers in the U.S. when the Gulf War broke out and devastated her community at home. \u201cMy mother ended up staying here because there was nothing to return to,\u201d says Shalabi.\n\nShalabi\u2019s father came to the U.S. for college and met her mother, who had worked hard to learn English and get into a top dental school. Even after they married and built new lives in America, they kept monitoring global politics that affected the friends, family and countries they loved.\n\n\u201cAl Jazeera was always on TV in our living room, especially during the invasion of Iraq and uprisings in Palestine. And when the revolutions [the Arab Spring] began in the Middle East, we were following all of it,\u201d Shalabi says. \u201cMy parents would ask, \u2018Do you truly know your roots?\u2019 and it would provoke me to look into it more.\u201d\n\n<b>Drawing from experience<\/b>\n\nWhile majoring in Law, Economics\u00a0&amp;\u00a0Public Policy at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uwb.edu\/\">UW Bothell<\/a>, Shalabi was inspired by her professors to research the issues that have affected her family \u2014 and to use her perspective as a Muslim to guide her work. Bruce Kochis, who teaches at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uwb.edu\/ias\">School of Interdisciplinary Arts &amp; Sciences<\/a>, \u201cencouraged students to explore the idea of religion,\u201d Shalabi says. \u201cIf I was talking about my faith, he would say, \u2018Write about it. Explain it in your class.\u2019 And that was something I had never really experienced before.\u201d\n\nWhen Shalabi sought out Kochis as an adviser for a research project, he continued urging her to draw from her personal experiences.\n\n\u201cHe asked me, \u2018What\u2019s the one thing that sticks out to you when you speak to Syrians back home or here?\u2019 says Shalabi. \u201cAnd it was the torture\u201d \u2014 specifically, the targeted torture and murder of Sunni Muslims in Syrian prisons.\n\nFor her research, Shalabi traveled to Amman, Jordan, where she visited a care center for Syrian refugees and spoke with a psychologist who treated victims of torture. She also interviewed a man who had survived a stint in a Syrian prison.\n\n\u201cI met with him in a caf\u00e9. People around us were laughing and enjoying their day, and he was calmly telling me the most horrendous things you could ever imagine being done to a person,\u201d Shalabi says. \u201cIt hit me at that moment: There are many thousands of people detained in Syria right now. This is their reality \u2014 they\u2019re living in an entirely different world.\u201d\n\n<b>Bringing Syrian voices to Washington<\/b>\n\nShalabi returned with a sense of responsibility to help share with Westerners the stories she\u2019d heard during her travels. She had conducted the interviews in Arabic, which she grew up speaking at home, then translated them into English.\n\nHer resulting paper, an exploration of the cruel treatment in Syrian prisons, details sectarian abuses and examines the civil war\u2019s religious dimensions. While much of the West\u2019s attention is trained on ISIS, Shalabi focuses on those who are too often left out of the narrative: Syrian citizens marginalized by the government of Bashar al-Assad, especially those at odds with its increasingly sectarian leanings.\n\n\u201cThe more I read, the more responsibility I felt,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is a way of bringing the Syrian voice into the West.\u201d\n\nShalabi\u2019s work earned her an undergraduate research award. \u201cMy mother cried when I won,\u201d she says. \u201cIt meant the world to her that her children are able to do what her generation and her father\u2019s generation couldn\u2019t: speak a word of justice against an oppressive tyrant.\u201d\n\n\u201cMalak has an unquestionable commitment to giving voice to oppressed populations,\u201d says Karam Dana, assistant professor at the UW Bothell School of Interdisciplinary Arts &amp; Sciences. \u201cHer findings can help us study religious communities that are scrutinized, oppressed and targeted around the world.\u201d\n\n<b>Active in the community<\/b>\n\nStaying connected to her roots has also motivated Shalabi to help others forge \u2014 or regain \u2014 connections to their homelands. For nearly a year, she ran Free Syria Seattle, a grassroots organization that engaged local activists with Syrians in a stand against oppression by facilitating discussions, art exhibits and protests.\n\nMore recently, Shalabi has begun teaching Muslim youth groups about the history of Syria and the Middle East. \u201cSome people don\u2019t even flinch when they see the news about the violence in Syria,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to share what I\u2019ve learned with them.\u201d\n\nThis fall, Shalabi is headed to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.law.uw.edu\/\">UW Law School<\/a>, where she intends to study international law. \u201cSomeday, I hope that I can use my J.D. to help promote justice in the Muslim world,\u201d she says."},{"title":"Brewing success","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/brewing-success\/","tags":["foster-school-of-business","graduate-student","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"With support from the Foster School's Buerk Center for Entrepreneurship, four co-founders are turning a UW classroom project into a budding beverage company.","content":"(UW Homepage, March 2018)\n\nFounding a startup is not for the faint of heart \u2014 many try, but only a handful truly make it. Like the perfect cup of tea, success takes just the right combination of ingredients and time. It\u2019s a recipe that Minnie Yuan, \u201917, Karin Soyama, \u201917, Kathy Tuan, \u201918, and Amie Hsieh, \u201917, know well.\n\nThe four co-founders of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drinknastea.com\/\">Nastea &amp; Co.<\/a> met on the first day of winter quarter in 2017, in a Foster School of Business class called Creating a Company.\n\nWhat made the class special was its participants: Students came from a range of non-business majors, including biology, communication, and human-centered design and engineering. Each group of students was tasked with starting a company from scratch. Using their various strengths \u2014 Yuan\u2019s optimism, Tuan\u2019s love of food science, Soyama\u2019s analytical mindset and Hsieh\u2019s pragmatism \u2014 the Nastea team began brainstorming.\n\n\u201cWe somehow got to the idea of bottling a beverage,\u201d says Yuan. \u201cAnd we were thinking about what would bring the most value,\u201d Tuan adds. \u201cWhat could we do better than other people?\u201d\n\nThen inspiration struck: Soyama and Tuan proposed the idea of white coffee dirty chai. This chai tea latte with a shot of white coffee espresso is increasing in popularity, but it\u2019s still a drink \u201cthat you really can\u2019t find in the market right now,\u201d explains Tuan.\n\n<b>Embracing uncertainty<\/b>\n\nInspired by their product plan, the team spent the rest of their time in the class engaging in research, creating an operating plan \u2014 and, of course, developing their recipe.\n\nFrom the beginning, Foster School instructor Rob Adams could see that the team had potential for real-world success.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re an entrepreneur, you need to be a little overly optimistic, because a lot of people are going to tell you that your idea won\u2019t work,\u201d says Adams, now the director of the UW\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/foster.uw.edu\/centers\/buerk-ctr-entrepreneurship\/\">Buerk Center for Entrepreneurship<\/a>. \u201cThat optimism enables you to overcome all the obstacles you can run into, and the Nastea team definitely has that.\u201d\n\nThe team also had skill and luck on their side: Their first successful bottled product took just two and a half weeks to create, despite the 40 different combinations of ingredients. By the time the class ended, the team had a viable product and a plan to take Nastea to market. With Adams\u2019 encouragement, they were ready to start building their business.\n\n<b>Full speed ahead<\/b>\n\nIn spring 2017, the Nastea team moved operations to a shared kitchen space in Seattle\u2019s South Park neighborhood and began ramping up production. Three of the women graduated in June, allowing them to devote more time to growing the company.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t leave the UW far behind. Their connections from Creating a Company continued to prove incredibly valuable.\n\nNear the end of spring quarter, the founders of Joe Chocolates \u2014 a startup that emerged from the same class in 2016 \u2014 had recommended that the Nastea team apply for the <a href=\"https:\/\/foster.uw.edu\/centers\/buerk-ctr-entrepreneurship\/jones-foster-accelerator-program\/\">Jones + Foster Accelerator program<\/a> offered through the Buerk Center.\n\nDesigned for early-stage and student-led businesses, the program runs for six months. It provides participating teams with mentorship from a committee of local entrepreneurs and investors, as well as a no-strings-attached $25,000 in funding for companies that complete the program successfully. The Nastea founders were admitted to the 2017-18 cohort.\n\nDuring Jones + Foster, teams must hit a number of milestones tailored to their businesses. Nastea\u2019s leadership set goals to grow their brand on social media, boost the number of bottles they could produce each week and prolong their product\u2019s shelf life.\n\nFirst up, production: Initially able to produce a batch of 50 bottles in six hours, the team can now make upward of 300 bottles in half that time. They have also expanded their product line to include a matcha flavor.\n\nWhen their Jones + Foster program ended in February 2018, the team learned that they would indeed receive the $25,000 \u2014 a huge vote of confidence in the company.\n\n\u201cI felt very grateful and stoked, but mostly proud of the team, reflecting on what we\u2019ve accomplished in the past six months,\u201d Soyama says. \u201cThe funding also gives us a lot of flexibility in continuing our company.\u201d\n\n<b>Keep calm and brew on<\/b>\n\nDuring the process of creating Nastea, the founders have learned to embrace and adapt to uncertainty. \u201cWe\u2019re still figuring it out as we go,\u201d Tuan says.\n\nBut bolstered by knowledge from Creating a Company, along with mentorship and the funding from Jones + Foster, the team is excited to keep expanding. Currently, Nastea beverages can be found in 14 different caf\u00e9s and grocery stores across Seattle.\n\nAs they look forward to the challenges and rewards ahead, Yuan, Soyama, Tuan and Hsieh hope that other people who dream of becoming entrepreneurs will be inspired by their story. \u201cSometimes it feels scary, and there are a lot of ups and downs. But I would trade nothing for this experience,\u201d Tuan says. \u201cAnd knowing that people will take a sip, smile and think \u2018This is so good\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s worth it.\u201d"},{"title":"Planning and purpose","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/planning-and-purpose\/","tags":["continuum-college","pce"],"pillars":[""],"image":"","excerpt":"Learn about the thriving Master of Science in Computational Linguistics and hear from program director, Emily Bender.","content":"(Continuum College, April 2018)\n\n<b>TALKING TO YOUR COMPUTER IS THE NEW NORMAL. BUT TO GET A COMPUTER TO ANSWER BACK INTELLIGENTLY \u2014 THAT TAKES EXPERTS IN COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS,\u00a0A FIELD FOCUSED ON HOW COMPUTERS PROCESS NATURAL LANGUAGE IN SPEECH AND TEXT.<\/b>\n\nComputational linguistics is in the science behind grammar checkers and predictive prompts for search engines and text messages, as well as voice user interfaces such as Alexa, Siri and Google Home. Computational linguistics also informs technologies that aid areas such as legal discovery, biomedical informatics and business intelligence.\n\nSeattle\u2019s high-tech job boom, and the parallel rise in smart language technologies, have meant big interest in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.compling.uw.edu\/\">UW Master of Science in Computational Linguistics<\/a> (CLMS), a fee-based degree developed in partnership with UW Continuum College.\n\nThe program is thriving, thanks to prescience and purpose. More than 200 students have graduated since 2005, and students are applying at record pace.\n\n\u201cThis [success] is, in large part, \u2018right place, right time,\u2019\u201d said Director of the CLMS program and Professor of linguistics, Emily Bender. \u201cAnd then also having done some things right over the years to be able to take advantage of it.\u201d\n\nOPTIONS THAT FIT STUDENT NEEDS\n\nWhen the CLMS program launched in 2005, it was designed as a one-year program for students already trained in computer science. The program was quickly expanded to also serve students with a background in linguistics. In 2007, students from both backgrounds gained flexible learning options when online components were first added to the curriculum. Now, as Bender explained, fully online learners make up about one third of a typical cohort.\n\nStudents with computer science experience can complete the nine courses in this program in one year, including a capstone project or internship; a thesis option typically takes 18 months. For students who work full time or need additional classes in math or computer science, there\u2019s the newer part-time option, which can be done in two to three years.\n\nFor those who aren\u2019t able or ready to take the degree program, the CLMS program also includes an embedded <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pce.uw.edu\/certificates\/natural-language-technology\">Certificate in Natural Language Technology<\/a>. This certificate begins with an overview of the interdisciplinary fields that form the foundation of computational linguistics. Credits from two of the certificate\u2019s three courses can be applied toward earning the CLMS degree.\n\nAs specific technologies will always change, the degree is designed to give students foundational skills for the long term: \u201cIt would be hopeless to try to keep up with whatever the hottest thing is each year,\u201d Bender said.\n\nApplications to the CLMS program have risen steadily since 2013, and the next cohort of 45 students is expected to be a high point. According to Bender, nearly 275 applications are already complete or in progress for the coming academic year.\n\nEFFICIENCIES THAT FOSTER SUCCESS\n\nOver the years, the CLMS program has discovered several efficiencies that reduce overhead and improve student services:\n<ul>\n\t<li>The program\u2019s website includes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.compling.uw.edu\/admissions\/preparing-for-the-program\/\">a checklist<\/a> of ways prospective students can start to prepare for the program, even as much as two years before they might enroll. \u201cYou don't need a full computer science degree, but here's what you need,\u201d Bender described. \u201cWe started seeing people tick these boxes. This has been a huge benefit.\u201d<\/li>\n\t<li><\/li>\n\t<li>Staff maximize time during a two-day orientation at the start of each session, which students can attend in person. The orientation is also broadcast online for distance learners, so staff are able to reduce advising costs by answering questions all at once.<\/li>\n\t<li><\/li>\n\t<li>The program asks students to upload real-time information about their academic progress to an internal database, which helps administrators plan for enrollments in core courses.<\/li>\n\t<li><\/li>\n\t<li>By offering the option to learn and study online or in person (or a combination of both), the program gives students flexibility in where and when they learn. \u201cThey can go back and forth between in person and online,\u201d Bender said. \u201cIn Seattle or not in Seattle \u2026 they don't have to decide ahead of time.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nBENEFITS OF NETWORKING\n\nThe program measures success, in part, by tracking job placements \u2014 187 to date \u2014 using information provided by alumni along with LinkedIn data.\n\n\u201cWe put a big emphasis on networks that are useful for the students,\u201d Bender said.\n\nBender also asks alumni about the salaries they earn after graduation. The program uses the salary information to recruit students, build alumni networks and give fellow graduates additional negotiating power.\n\nROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nThree full-time faculty develop the CLMS curriculum and teach courses, while also fulfilling additional duties at the University. Working with a program coordinator and assistant administrator, they also maintain data servers, advise students and oversee admissions.\n\n<i>We didn\u2019t have to prove ourselves with existing resources that we could get enough students so that we could then hire new faculty. That\u2019s been a huge part of our success.<\/i>\n\n<i>\u2014 Emily Bender<\/i>\n\nBut for so much of what makes the program possible \u2014 budgets, direct marketing, enrollment services, web pages and more \u2014 Bender noted that they rely on the experts at UW Continuum College.\n\nOther universities have created similar programs by piecing together existing courses in computer science and linguistics. But at the UW, as Bender explained, five of the six core courses \u2014 and all of the electives \u2014 were designed specifically for this master\u2019s program. With start-up support from UW Continuum College, the CLMS program was able to develop thoughtfully.\n\n\u201cWe have something that\u2019s purpose built,\u201d Bender said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to prove ourselves with existing resources that we could get enough students so that we could then hire new faculty.

When the program was looking for a new adviser just a few months later, he jumped at the chance to again be part of the program that helped him reach a long-held goal.\n\n\u201cI thought about going back to college for a long time,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t expect it to be an option until I learned about the ISS program.

He went to work in the video game industry, managing operations and marketing for some of the hottest gaming of the last decade, including Square Enix\u2019s Final Fantasy, Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Live Arcade, Ubisoft\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed and Madden NFL by EA Sports.\n\nHe\u2019s still a big fan of video games and board games (you\u2019d be wise to ask him for advice before your next game of Pandemic), but after a decade of work in the gaming field, he felt ready for a professional change.\n\nMcConnell enrolled in the University of Washington ISS program as a full-time student, focusing some of his research on the social science of gamification and graduating with highest distinction in just nine months. He studied how extrinsic and intrinsic rewards influence motivation and learning, which furthered his interest in pursuing a career in education.\n\nEXPERIENCES IN ISS\n\n<i>Education is changing, and I think ISS and UW Continuum College are really in the forefront for a lot of those changes.<\/i>\n\n<i>\u2014 Daniel McConnell<\/i>\n\nWhen McConnell first reached out to learn about the ISS degree completion option, he connected with then-adviser, now-colleague Aimee Kelly, who he says offered him inspirational encouragement as he enrolled, completed his degree and began his job search.\n\nAs a student, McConnell didn\u2019t realize how much time his now-colleagues put in to help develop the program\u2019s core courses and ensure the modules make sense for students \u2014 and that\u2019s in addition to the time they spend advising students one-on-one.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised at the amount of work that the advisers do that is not seen by students,\u201d he said. \u201cThe advising team is so involved and so caring \u2014 and just full of some really good, smart people. Education is changing, and I think ISS and UW Continuum College are really in the forefront for a lot of those changes.\u201d\n\nGOOD QUESTIONS\n\nJust a few weeks into his role with the ISS team, McConnell had already helped prospective students think about time management, study habits and how to prepare for successful admission to the UW. He looks forward to working with admitted students this spring.\n\nStudents have very personal reasons for wanting to complete a college degree: job advancement, switching careers, supporting a family, personal fulfillment \u2014 sometimes all of the above. McConnell said he wants to help students think about their own motivations for returning to school and make sure they have the support they need to enjoy their learning.\n\nFor example, rather than starting with a focus on specific courses, McConnell wants to help students think bigger \u2014 about what social issues they find interesting, where they already have expertise, where they\u2019d like to become more knowledgeable.\n\n\u201cThink of school not just as a checklist, but as an opportunity to really grow as a person,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do I like about the world? What do I want to change? Where do I want to grow?\u201d These are questions McConnell wants to encourage students to consider. \u201cYou\u2019re here; you\u2019re going to get a diploma if you do everything.

And so it's important for us to have that opportunity to instill it, right from the beginning.\u201d\n\n<b>REACHING NATIVE EDUCATORS<\/b>\n\nHer personal and professional journey also led Tleena to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pce.uw.edu\/certificates\/native-education\">Certificate in Native Education<\/a> program at the University of Washington. The innovative two-year program is designed to give educators \u2014 both Native and non-Native \u2014 the essential knowledge and skills needed to help Native American students thrive in their schools and communities.\n\nThe in-depth learning experience offered by this program connects well with Tleena\u2019s professional role.\n\n\u201cThe certificate program is a perfect fit for the work I\u2019m doing, even though I\u2019m not necessarily in the field as much as educators are,\u201d she said. \u201cIt helps give me an understanding of what our educators are doing to prepare Native learners and work with them.\u201d\n\n<b>ONLINE FLEXIBILITY AND THE FAMILY<\/b>\n\n<i>My experience has been absolutely amazing and beautiful ... I feel like the program is going to explode and grow and help our tribal communities.<\/i>\n\n\u2014\n\nTleena Ives\n\nBecause the certificate program attracts students from a wide range of communities all around the state, it\u2019s delivered primarily online. Participants get together at the UW for a three-day Summer Institute to kick off the program, then interact through a variety of online tools and platforms for their classes.\n\nFor Tleena, a mother of four with a demanding job, this format has been key to enabling her to complete the program. It\u2019s also allowed her to extend the learning experience to her family.\n\n\u201cHaving the ability to participate in the comfort of my home has been really important to me,\u201d said Tleena, who works in Olympia and lives in her Native community more than an hour\u2019s drive from the UW campus.\n\n\u201cIt provides that better work-life balance, but also as an example for my children,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey're often around me working on homework or sitting near, so they can also listen to the instructor-led discussions, which usually continue into our family conversations.\u201d\n\n<b>LOOKING TO THE FUTURE<\/b>\n\nOne more goal of the Certificate in Native Education is to sow the seeds of learning for the next generation of Native teachers and educational leaders. Tleena is a prime example, as she\u2019s also earning graduate-level academic credit through the program.\n\n\u201cI hope to eventually move on to complete\u00a0a master's degree,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like this program is the little baby step that I've needed to get back onto the right track of completing my education and continuing on. It\u2019s been inspiring.\u201d\n\nFor Tleena, the certificate program is part of a bright future for Native education in the region.\n\n\u201cMy experience has been absolutely amazing and beautiful, and I highly recommend the program to everyone, from those in early learning, K-12, higher education, parents and tribal leaders,\u201d Tleena said. \u201cI feel like the program is going to explode and grow and help our tribal communities.\u201d"},{"title":"A week in the wild: field lessons","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/a-week-in-the-wild-field-lessons-2\/","tags":["college-of-the-environment","giving","graduate-student","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Students and professors from the College of the Environment made a classroom out of one of the world's most closely monitored ecosystems: Yellowstone National Park.","content":"(Homepage, 2018)\n\nThrough the shimmering heat waves of a midafternoon sunbreak, hundreds of yards across the silent expanse of the Lamar Valley, students can barely see three wolves through a spotting scope. The elusive animals are curled up in the snow, camouflaged against a backdrop of brown sage.\n\nAll week long, during a springtime experiential learning course in Yellowstone National Park, students from the University of Washington have been hoping to catch a glimpse of the iconic predator. Now they take turns sharing the scope, each getting a brief but precious look.\n\nIt\u2019s the class\u2019s last day in the park, and while this much-hoped-for sighting is the exclamation point on their pilgrimage, the experience has been about so much more than wolves.\n\n<b>Why Yellowstone?<\/b>\n\nA week of intensive fieldwork followed by a research project and presentation,\u00a0the School of Environmental and Forest Sciences\u2019\u00a0course \u201cWildlife Conservation in Northwest Ecosystems\u201d teaches UW\u00a0students about the intertwined ecosystem of America\u2019s oldest national park.\n\nSome students have already done several animal surveys at the UW. Others are just dipping their toes into research and have never even been to a national park. Leading them in the field are professors John Marzluff, a bird expert with a focus on ravens, crows and jays; Aaron Wirsing, who studies how large carnivores shape the behavior of their prey; and Beth Gardner, who uses mathematical models to monitor and manage wildlife, plant and fisheries populations. Together, they teach their students about the rigors of science, life in the field \u2014 and what their futures might look like.\n\nYellowstone has long been a bellwether for scientists to study how ecosystems work. Learning about both wildlife and humans here has given students an experience they\u2019ll bring back to their classrooms in Washington \u2014 and to their careers in the wide landscape beyond.\n\n<b>Experience the park<\/b>\n\nIn the vignettes below, read more about who the students met in Yellowstone, the animals they saw and studied, and what they discovered about the challenges and rewards of careers in wildlife management.\n\n<b>On the trail of cougars<\/b>\n\nNikki Furner, a UW junior, trudges through mud and snow back to the Hellroaring Creek trailhead. She and the rest of the class just met in the backcountry with Connor Meyer, \u201916, who took this very class in 2015 and now works in the park as a wildlife technician.\n\n\u201cWhen I was on this trip, we got to talk to some of the wildlife technicians, and we were able to help with some research,\u201d says Meyer. \u201cThis experience drove me to find a way to come back when I graduated.\u201d\n\nAfter leading the students on a hike to the remnants of a cougar-killed elk, Meyer explained how he helps monitor cougar populations in the park. He also gave the class a glimpse into how they might track and gather data on wild animals someday.\n\n\u201cGoing to Yellowstone with wildlife biologists is like going behind the scenes of a play,\u201d says Furner. She definitely sees a future doing fieldwork, she adds.\n\nFor students like Furner, learning about predators is one thing. But seeing \u2014 and tracking, listening, collecting data and asking questions of experts in the field \u2014 is believing.\n\n<b>Predators and ecosystems<\/b>\n\nLessons from Yellowstone are often applied in our own state. Researchers who want to know how wolf recovery and grizzly reintroduction might influence Washington ecosystems can turn to what experts have learned from the park: What has worked? What hasn\u2019t? Where do conflicts between people and predators develop? When it comes to very wild places that can teach us how ecosystems work, Yellowstone is king.\n\n<b>Following elk, gathering data<\/b>\n\nIt\u2019s 7:08 a.m. Professor Wirsing and students Andrew Wang, Jenny Brent, Hannah Booth and Suzannah Yu crouch behind snow-covered sagebrush and spy on a group of elk on a ridge across the Yellowstone River. They\u2019re gathering data for a project Wirsing has been running since 2012. How do elk behave in relation to their landscape? Their herd size? Their position in the herd?\n\nBooth keeps the scope on a single elk for 15 minutes, noting every 30 seconds what it\u2019s doing: \u201cForaging.\u201d \u201cBedded.\u201d \u201cVigilant.\u201d Yu keeps the time, and Wang notes the behaviors. Field research like this is often tedious, painstaking and uncomfortable. But once those 15 minutes are up, there\u2019s a sense of accomplishment. It may be one sheet of data among sheaths, but it\u2019s important \u2014 and the students have contributed.\n\n<b>Knowing what we don\u2019t know<\/b>\n\nDecades of research in Yellowstone have produced a treasure trove of information \u2014 and exposed research gaps. Scientists need to identify what they don\u2019t know to help wildlife managers make better plans. Take the case of the elk: Biologists are still learning how many animals Yellowstone can support, and ongoing research is critical.\n\n<b>Ravens in search of a meal<\/b>\n\nProfessor Marzluff and a group of students have pulled over at Blacktail Pond. Some 150 yards from the road, a grizzly is feasting on the remains of a bison that plunged through thin ice and drowned over the winter \u2014 then was dragged out in the spring for an easy meal.\n\nRavens fight over the scraps of another unfortunate bison nearby, and coyotes lurk as they wait their turn. Marzluff \u201ctranslates\u201d the ravens\u2019 vocalizations: \u201cThat one\u2019s begging. That one\u2019s asserting dominance. That one\u2019s just been pecked.\u201d\n\nThe students are in the middle of a bird survey. They\u2019re shuttled every half-mile to make note of how many ravens, magpies, golden eagles and bald eagles they see. They\u2019ve stopped to watch the grizzly, but soon they\u2019ll return to their data quest, adding to a decades-deep database that shows scavenger dispersal throughout the park. It\u2019s valuable information: Scientists can use it to look into where scavengers go, when and why.\n\n<b>It\u2019s in the details<\/b>\n\nField science requires true commitment. Students listen intently for crows, jays and magpies, jotting down minute details: temperature, wind strength and cloud cover. It\u2019s arduous and detail-oriented work. Students find this out quickly during the class, gaining key insights about whether or not this is the right career path for them.\n\n<b>Finding common ground<\/b>\n\nHigh up in Montana\u2019s Tom Miner Basin, rimmed by peaks that approach 10,000 feet, the Anderson Ranch is just a few miles north of the Yellowstone border. Inevitably, wild animals migrate in and out of the park \u2014 some making their homes on the ranch, some just passing through. The basin is also home to a growing collective of ranchers who work to coexist with wild animals. Hilary Anderson is one of them.\n\nOn a blustery day, she explains best practices for raising livestock on land that predators frequent: Fladry \u2014 brightly colored flags strung up on property borders \u2014 serves as a visual deterrent to wolves. Moving dead livestock away from a herd, or vice versa, is an example of carcass management, and it aims to put distance between living livestock and hungry scavengers. And finally, there\u2019s range riding: traveling the acreage via horse, demonstrating a human presence and keeping predators at bay.\n\nAnderson also speaks to the value of working to find common ground among the basin\u2019s residents, a crucial step to overcoming widely different opinions on how to handle an increase in predator levels. Building trust, she explains, is invaluable.\n\n\u201cBut how do you win people over to your side?\u201d a student asks.\n\n\u201cBy not making it a side,\u201d Anderson says.\n\n<b>The human landscape<\/b>\n\nEven the best management practices fail if they don\u2019t consider the needs of people living in the ecosystem. Park biologists and ranchers tell students directly: There are conflicts over how to manage parks for both people and wildlife. Many new researchers don\u2019t have that perspective, which limits how well they build trust with locals in the field \u2014 and which, in turn, can affect the success of their science.\n\n<b>Back home in Washington<\/b>\n\nIn late May 2017, the students reconvene in Anderson Hall on the UW campus. They\u2019ve spent weeks preparing presentations that demonstrate how research in Yellowstone is relevant to Washingtonians.\n\nOne group of students from the course has analyzed how human roads and trails affect the hunting habits of wolves and cougars, and what this might mean as our state\u2019s wolf population continues to recover and expand. Another group has looked at the dining habits of scavengers such as ravens, eagles and bears, making predictions about how those populations might fluctuate as wolf populations grow \u2014 and what the effect of climate change might be on scavengers\u2019 diets.\n\nA third group has studied bison migration inside and outside Yellowstone, as well as the complexities, worries and politics involved.\n\nJunior Hannah Booth\u2019s big takeaway is that, whether it\u2019s about wildlife management in Yellowstone or here in Washington, \u201cThere\u2019s room for education on both sides of any conservation debate.\u201d\n\nThis education includes UW students. During their week in the wild, they explored Yellowstone\u2019s plateaus and valleys alongside scientists. They studied the varied landscape of the region\u2019s wildlife management policies. And they gathered data themselves, demonstrating that what they\u2019ve learned in America\u2019s oldest national park can inform the work they do back at the UW \u2014 and in their future careers in wildlife management."},{"title":"Garden cities","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/garden-cities\/","tags":["college-of-built-environments","giving","graduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"At the UW's College of Built Environments, students like David de la Cruz, '17, are partnering with some of the world's most vulnerable communities in the fight for environmental justice.","content":"(College of Built Environments, 2017)\n\nDavid de la Cruz has a question about power. \u201cWhen we think about toxic sites and where they\u2019re placed in relation to where people live, who\u2019s left out of making those decisions?\u201d\n\n\u201cOften,\u201d he answers, \u201cit\u2019s the people who live there. It\u2019s low-income communities, working-class communities and communities of color who don\u2019t have a say. They\u2019re the ones who have to deal with the consequences of living close to a grain mill facility that constantly sees truck traffic, or living close to a yard that has trains passing back and forth.\u201d\n\nAnd while these communities have some autonomy, he says, people are moving into areas that are already extensively polluted. There\u2019s often no decision to be made \u2014 pollution is part of the package.\n\n<i>Where<\/i> you live affects <i>how<\/i> you live.\n\nDe la Cruz, a 2017 graduate of the <a href=\"http:\/\/be.uw.edu\/\">College of Built Environments<\/a>\u2019 master of <a href=\"http:\/\/larch.be.uw.edu\/\">landscape architecture program<\/a>, grew up in Pueblo del Rio, a public housing project in South Central Los Angeles located just southwest of the Los Angeles River.\n\nThe \u201cgarden city\u201d complex \u2014 named for the open, grassy spaces that separate the rows of two-story buildings \u2014 went up in the early 1940s to support low-income, primarily black laborers who were flooding into the city to work in the defense industry in the wake of the Great Depression. South Central LA is the industrial center of the city, which has some of the most polluted air in the nation.\n\nNearly 80 years later, the projects still house low-income black, Latino and Cambodian communities. And decades of inequity have left a void of opportunity that negatively affects the health, happiness and well-being of residents, who have limited ways to make change.\n\nBut de la Cruz has a vision for change. Now, he\u2019s returning from the UW to the community that raised him to partner with locals to help make the projects \u2014 and the world \u2014 a more environmentally equitable place for all.\n\nCreating a world where all people can live healthier and more fulfilling lives is also the mission of the UW\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/uw.edu\/populationhealth\">Population Health Initiative<\/a>, which leverages capabilities and opportunities at the UW and beyond to advance well-being on a local and global scale.\n\nThe spirit of what the College of Built Environments calls \u201cemergent-convergent design\u201d \u2014 community-driven projects that start small but contribute to a large-scale vision \u2014 pulses through the College. But it may run strongest where de la Cruz found his academic home at the UW: the Informal Urban Communities Initiative, a donor-supported design activism, research and education program cofounded by associate professor of landscape architecture Ben Spencer.\n\n\u201cI was really interested in working with landscape architecture professors like Ben Spencer who have this emphasis on community engagement,\u201d says de la Cruz, whose work was supported by the Margaret and Fritz Wagner Family Endowed Fellowship, the Norman J. Johnston Endowed Scholarship, and the University of Washington Graduate Opportunity Award.\n\nThat emphasis is what inspired de la Cruz to apply to the UW, where socially responsible design is a solution to some of the world\u2019s greatest health and equity challenges.\n\nHe was also inspired by his mother, a longtime community leader in Pueblo del Rio whose outreach has included setting up neighborhood food banks and hosting support groups for widows and women who have experienced domestic violence. \u201cSeeing my mother\u2019s commitment to this idea of the collective well-being of her community \u2014 and the faith her community has in her \u2014 has shaped the work that I do.\u201d\n\nBy deploying students like de la Cruz to work with residents on local improvement projects, the Informal Urban Communities Initiative aims to form cultural connections, then give some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable communities a hand up.\n\nAmong the most vulnerable populations are informal urban communities (commonly referred to as \u201cslums\u201d) on the outskirts of Lima, Peru, and Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Philanthropy-supported study-abroad opportunities enabled de la Cruz and his peers to spend extended time at each site, where they witnessed firsthand what environmental injustice looks like around the world \u2014 as well as the looming threats faced by underprivileged populations.\n\nThese ranged from gentrification to displacement to toxic-emissions exposure. Some communities are plagued by drought, others by flooding. These historically oppressed groups have a feeling of being disposable, says de la Cruz. His goal? To work with communities to create longstanding solutions, together \u2014 an ethos core to the College of Built Environments.\n\nThrough participatory design workshops, de la Cruz and the Informal Urban Communities Initiative partnered with residents, community leaders and local agencies as they worked to implement environments that better served the residents\u2019 needs, whether that meant harvesting fog and constructing gardens to address a lack of water and food security in Lima or creating a safe, attractive green alleyway to enjoy in Phnom Penh. \u201cMy international experiences taught me how to build and cultivate working relationships with communities that have a wealth of information to tap into,\u201d says de la Cruz. \u201cNow I know what a successful workshop looks like and how to ensure that decisions are made in a way that benefits community members.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmphasizing community engagement and the lived experiences of community members is how I expect to continue my role as a landscape architect,\u201d says de la Cruz. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in: community well-being through community collaboration.\u201d\n\nAs the 2017 National Olmsted Scholar \u2014\u00a0named by the premier national award program for landscape architecture students \u2014 he\u2019ll have the chance to pursue this goal as he returns to South Central LA to address its most urgent threats: pollution, gentrification, displacement. (The restoration of the Los Angeles River, which involves all three, is high on his list.) He\u2019s already applied his studies to the real world, hosting two workshops back in South Central LA that pulled in artists, park rangers, housing services coordinators and residents to mobilize de la Cruz\u2019s community and imagine a neighborhood that trades industrial sites for green space.\n\nThe work has started, says de la Cruz. \u201cPeople have found ways to thrive in these environments regardless of the systemic issues that suppress them. Walk down a few aisles from here, and you can see all these plants that people grow,\u201d he says from his mother\u2019s kitchen table, motioning outside to the grassy lawns separating the rows of apartments. \u201cThey\u2019ve found a way to connect to the soil that\u2019s here, which the plants have the potential to clean up. Even though it\u2019s not at a systemic level, people have found ways to have some sort of control over their own health through the way they intervene right in their front yards.\u201d\n\nBy applying this community knowledge on a larger scale, landscape architecture can combat widespread issues at the systemic level. \u201cThere are leaders in these communities,\u201d says de la Cruz. \u201cThe intention is that they collaborate to take on projects at a front-yard level using local knowledge.\u201d From there, he explains, they can scale up and shape healthier environments.\n\nThe impact of landscape architecture on the well-being of residents in Los Angeles, Seattle and around the world is monumental \u2014 and thanks in part to private gifts of support, de la Cruz has gained the knowledge to work toward ensuring a strong, positive future for everyone.\n\n\u201cThrough community involvement and participation, I\u2019m hoping to work with residents to articulate how we can transform these larger infrastructures \u2014 ghosted railways, abandoned factories, the Los Angeles River \u2014 in a way that benefits them,\u201d says de la Cruz. \u201cSo much knowledge already exists in these communities, and there are opportunities to have more landscape architects who come from diverse backgrounds. My mission isn\u2019t to lead, but to help community members realize their leadership potential.\u201d\n\n<i>Update<\/i>: After returning to his hometown, de la Cruz started working as a project manager for the Los Angeles Neighborhood Land Trust, an organization that creates parks and community gardens in underserved neighborhoods that have limited or no access to green space. He has also led an urban agriculture and community gardening workshop for local youth that was promoted by College Track, an organization focused on increasing educational attainment rates in communities of color nationwide."},{"title":"The wordsmith","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/the-wordsmith\/","tags":["alumni","continuum-college","pce"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Al Smith wanted to build a career in writing and editing, but needed a boost to get started.

It makes us ready to face the magic of Seattle, where everything\u2019s always changing and we\u2019re changing the world.\u201d\n\nCRITICAL CONNECTIONS\n\nThe Certificate in Project Management is approved by both the <a href=\"http:\/\/foster.uw.edu\/\">UW Foster School of Business<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/cm.be.washington.edu\/\">UW Department of Construction Management<\/a>. And, like many of the programs offered by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pce.uw.edu\/\">UW Professional &amp; Continuing Education<\/a>, it engages an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pce.uw.edu\/certificates\/project-management#modal_advisoryboard\">advisory board<\/a> \u2014 top thinkers, doers and leaders in the field who ensure course content stays relevant as industries evolve.\n\nAdvisory board member <a href=\"https:\/\/www.slalom.com\/people-profile-josh-bates\">Josh Bates<\/a> says project manager is an easy title for job seekers to claim, but the best have both formal training and practical experience. He should know: As a client service partner at Slalom Consulting, he hires and trains project managers who serve the firm\u2019s Seattle-area clients. Bates credits Continuum College for creating learning experiences that combine the best of UW\u2019s academic quality with expertise from outside the University.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical for the University to be connected with industry and understand what these graduates need,\u201d Bates says. \u201cWhen employers look at project managers who have a certificate from the University of Washington, they know they\u2019ve been through a rigorous program.\u201d\n\nA DESTINATION FOR PEOPLE WHO CARE\n\nProject management is evolving in the knowledge economy, just like many professionals in the workforce. Certificates are critical for workers who want to retool, says Bates, an attorney by training who pivoted his own career to project management; he\u2019s now a 20-year veteran of the field.\n\n\u201cI love being able to share some of what I've learned in all the different industries I've worked in over the years,\u201d he says of his advisory-board role. \u201cI love that we have instructors who are doing the same, really imparting that knowledge to the students.\u201d\n\nThe project management certificate emphasizes relationships, and that\u2019s creating a nexus of leadership among grads. Its alumni are building career networks, and increasingly, UW-trained project managers are driving successful endeavors and improved services for constituents, customers and communities all around the Puget Sound.\n\nDiamond says she appreciates the range of students \u2014 from MBAs to learners with no previous formal training \u2014 who devote time to the kind of professional-education courses Continuum College helps develop.\n\n\u201cProject management is a destination for people who care and want to do more with less \u2014 and want to do it better, faster and with more sustainability,\u201d Diamond says. \u201cWhat they're coming to, every single one of them, is a journey of their own \u2014 to continue to learn, to continue to build.\u201d"},{"title":"Partnering on a new master's program","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/partnering-on-a-new-masters-program-2\/","tags":["continuum-college","graduate-school"],"pillars":["innovation"],"image":"","excerpt":"Bill Howe and UW Continuum College collaborate to make a new data science master's program a reality.","content":"(Continuum College, November 2016)\n\nBILL\u2019S STORY\n\n<b>BILL HOWE, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THE ESCIENCE INSTITUTE, AND CONTINUUM COLLEGE COLLABORATE TO MAKE NEW DATA SCIENCE MASTER\u2019S PROGRAM A REALITY.<\/b>\n\nBill Howe, program director and faculty chair of the new University of Washington <a href=\"https:\/\/www.datasciencemasters.uw.edu\/\">Master of Science in Data Science<\/a>, has a goal \u2014 to make the UW the premier place for all things data science.\n\nHe\u2019s off to an impressive start. The <a href=\"http:\/\/escience.washington.edu\/\">UW eScience Institute<\/a>, where Howe is associate director and senior data science fellow, gives researchers across all fields resources for data-intensive discovery. It also provides a space for data scientists and researchers to collaborate and apply advanced computational methods and tools to extract knowledge from big data.\n\nA BIG NEW PROGRAM IDEA FOR BIG DATA\n\nFrom the eScience Institute, Howe and Ed Lazowska, the founding director, have spearheaded data science education at many levels of the university. They\u2019re working across departments to create a template that describes a core data science education for undergraduates. They\u2019ve developed PhD programs specialized in big data and data science and an integrative program that crosses department boundaries. Howe teaches a MOOC in data science and has collaborated with Continuum College to create an eight-month <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pce.uw.edu\/certificates\/data-science\">Certificate in Data Science<\/a> program for professionals to hone their skills.\n\nWhat was missing in the puzzle, though, was something in between a PhD and a certificate \u2014 a professional master\u2019s degree.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping the master\u2019s degree will build a reputation for producing the most technically rigorous, most advanced, most successful students in data science, who can complement a team that might have PhD-level researchers as well,\u201d Howe said.\n\nTo help him build and run this master\u2019s program, Howe turned to Continuum College. \u201cContinuum College has been invaluable in helping us both design and now operate the program,\u201d Howe said. \u201cIt would have been almost impossible to put together without their help.\u201d\n\nTHE CENTRAL IDEA: MAKING CONTINUUM COLLEGE THE HUB\n\nData science is an interdisciplinary field, drawing on statistics, computer science, data visualization and more. To create the master\u2019s, Howe needed to solve another puzzle \u2014 how to bring together faculty from a record number of different departments to form a cohesive entity.\n\n\u201cThe benefit of building this six-department partnership is that we are able to get expertise from top-10 departments across the board to bear into one curriculum,\u201d Howe said. \u201cThe downside is that you have to organize across six completely separate campus units.\u201d\n\nInstead of divvying up administrative work between departments or having one department responsible for the others, Continuum College offered its services as an independent unit. \u201cThe centrality of their position on campus meant they could talk to all the different departments,\u201d Howe explained. \u201cThey provided the general leadership in driving this forward.\u201d\n\n<i>They provided the general leadership in driving this forward.<\/i>\n\n<i>\u2014 Bill Howe, Associate Director, eScience Institute, eScience Institute<\/i>\n\nIT ALL ADDS UP\n\n\u201cThe portfolio of services that Continuum College offers,\u201d Howe continued, \u201cyou can\u2019t get elsewhere.\u201d From market research and advertising to admissions and finances, Howe found Continuum College invaluable for creating the infrastructure for the master\u2019s program.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll say, answer these four or five questions and we\u2019ll turn that into an initial website for the entire program. We\u2019ll run an information session and an email campaign with some numbers on click-throughs. We\u2019ll coordinate on the application process,\u201d Howe explained.\n\nEXPANDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTINUING EDUCATION\n\nBecause the data science program is a professional master\u2019s degree, Continuum College used its expertise in adult education to tailor market research and messaging.\n\n\u201cThe interpretation of market research results, knowing the kinds of cohorts we can expect and how to advertise the program, all reflects a strong understanding of working professionals who are looking for continuing education,\u201d Howe said. \u201cContinuum College\u2019s institutional experience in understanding and reaching out to that cohort of potential students has been really important to us.\u201d"},{"title":"Spotlight on the Academic Partnership team","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/spotlight-on-the-academic-partnership-team-2\/","tags":["continuum-college"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Succeeding takes inspiration, dedication and motivation. And that's just what our Academic Partnership team is all about.","content":"(Continuum College, November 2017)\n\nAt UW Continuum College, we turn ideas into impact. Succeeding takes inspiration, dedication and motivation. And that\u2019s just what our Academic Partnership team, charged with managing the University of Washington\u2019s fee-based programs, is all about.\n\n\u201cWe want our campus partners to know that our motivation is to help their programs to be sustainable,\u201d says Sandra Janusch, Assistant Vice Provost of International &amp; Academic Programs. \u201cWe\u2019ve recently looked at how we work with academic departments and are thinking about how we can add even more value to these partnerships. We\u2019re here to ensure all fee-based programs thrive.\u201d\n\nThis past summer, Continuum College reorganized the portfolios of work for our directors and program managers. Instead of being assigned to a mix of credit and noncredit programs, teams are now dedicated either to noncredit certificate programs or to academic partnership for credit programs, such as fee-based degrees. The Academic Partnership team also supports Early Fall Start, Summer Quarter and UW in the High School.\n\nThis 14-member Academic Partnership team is here \u201cto provide personalized support for degrees, based on the needs of the departments,\u201d says Janusch, who leads the team along with directors Eric Irvin and Britta Simon. Janusch arrived at the UW in 2015 to lead the International &amp; English Language Programs; last year, she took on her current role as Assistant Vice Provost also leading Academic Programs.\n\nStarting a new degree program can be a daunting task, particularly for departments who have never created a fee-based degree program.\u00a0That\u2019s where the Academic Partnership team comes in. With dedicated points of contact in the Graduate School, the Office of Planning and Budgeting, the Office of the Provost, Disability Services, the Registrar\u2019s Office and Financial Aid, the Academic Partnership team leverages their network to plan and launch a program.\n\n\u201cWe provide program management, guiding the initial setup process, including the program budget creation. We also liaise with marketing and market research to ensure financial sustainability,\u201d says Simon, who earned her Ph.D. in Germanics from the UW and came to work for the University in 2010 after a career as a linguist and program manager at Microsoft.\n\nPartnering with the Academic Partnership team saves departments time as they don\u2019t have to do the research on requirements, deadlines and who\u2019s who; instead, their Academic Partnership team program manager does that for them.\n\n\u201cIt all starts with a conversation,\u201d explains Irvin, who has worked at the UW for 15 years and came to Continuum College 10 years ago from the School of Pharmacy. \u201cWe talk through a department's or faculty member\u2019s idea for a credit program and the requirements\u00a0\u2014 and we help them understand the implications.\u201d\n\nWhile there are common best practices, each new program idea generates its own unique questions \u2014 in part because each UW department is structured distinctively and because the goals for each program vary.\u00a0Academic Partnership team program managers also help departments determine the right learning format, or modality (classroom, online or a combination), for their program.\n\nIn some instances, departments already running a program are interested in growing it or exploring changes and need help evaluating how those changes will impact students. The Academic Partnership team is well positioned to help.\n\n\u201cOur group works with almost 80 programs. We have a broad understanding of program types and formats, which can help guide success,\u201d says Irvin. \u201cOur expertise is helpful in that we know how fee-based, self-sustaining programs work within a university context.\u201d\n\nA benefit to working with Continuum College that often surprises departments is that Continuum College takes on the financial risk of the programs they administer. \u201cIn the startup phase, programs go into deficit,\u201d says Simon. \u201cOur organization provides teams with funding during that period. Once revenue comes in, the deficit is reduced, but sometimes that takes several years.\u201d\n\nThis initial safety net means that departments can focus on their students and on a program's content rather than its near-term financial performance. \u201cWe\u2019re a pathway to being able to offer new and innovative programs in a time when there may not be state funding, or other funding, available to support that,\u201d says Irvin."},{"title":"Making a professional pivot","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/making-a-professional-pivot\/","tags":["alumni","continuum-college","pce"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Rebooting your career after a layoff can be tough.

It wasn\u2019t the news she was expecting.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a call to congratulate me on the new baby,\u201d said Nicole, who had nearly reached the 15-year mark working at a large investment bank. \u201cUnfortunately, it was to let me know that they had eliminated my position in the Seattle office. I was completely blindsided.\u201d\n\nBut instead of panicking, she decided to view her layoff as an opportunity to revitalize her career \u2014 and discover what she really felt passionate about.\n\n<b>DISCOVERING WHAT'S NEXT<\/b>\n\nNicole quickly realized that it was a little overwhelming to push the reset button at that stage in her career.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t looked for a job in 15 years, so it was a whole new world to me,\u201d she noted. \u201cAs I was building a LinkedIn profile, networking and fixing up my resume, I realized finding a new job \u2014 and really articulating my strengths and how I could add value to a company \u2014 wasn\u2019t as easy as I thought.\u201d\n\nDuring this process, Nicole became interested in the human resources field.

That\u2019s when she learned about the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pce.uw.edu\/certificates\/human-resources-management\">Certificate in Human Resources Management<\/a>.\n\n\u201cI found the UW certificate program while I was going through all of this exploration, and I thought, \u2018Perfect.\u2019 It had such a broad sampling of different HR-related subjects that I felt, \u2018Great, I can explore here.\u2019\u201d\n\n<b>FORGING CONNECTIONS<\/b>\n\nIn addition to learning about the different aspects of HR, Nicole found that making connections with her classmates and instructors was an extremely valuable aspect of the program.\n\n\u201cThe program was great because there were other people who were in career transition, like I was, and really pivoting into a brand new world,\u201d she explained. \u201cThere were also people there who'd been doing the work but didn't have any credentials or were trying to round out their skill sets. So it was a great way for me to network with other people who had an interest or a passion in the human capital side of the business.\u201d\n\nNicole also found value in the guest speakers and other professionals who visited the classroom to share their insider knowledge and tips.\n\n\"There were panels of experienced people from local companies that they would bring into the classes, so you had a chance to ask some really relevant questions about what's going on in the marketplace today, which was great,\u201d she said.\n\n<b>GAINING INSIGHT, GETTING THE JOB<\/b>\n\nDuring the program, Nicole developed a strong professional connection with instructor Michael Walters.\n\n\u201cI was lucky enough to meet Michael, who was great to learn from and so helpful in my discovery process around what kind of work I could do next,\u201d she said. \u201cHe helped me realize how critical HR is as a true business partner to companies, and I was inspired to figure out how I could add meaningful value.\"\n\nThis connection allowed Nicole to gain real-world exposure to HR, helping her decide that the field was a good match.\n\n\"Towards the end of the program I still wasn\u2019t sure which direction I wanted to go in, given my background wasn't in HR,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI asked Michael if he would be open to letting me job shadow a few people in HR at his company, and he was really gracious and said, \u2018Sure, come check it out.\u2019 It was such a great day!\u201d\n\nShortly after that visit, Nicole interviewed at Brighton Jones, the Seattle wealth management company where she now works as the director of talent acquisition.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been three years now, and I couldn\u2019t be happier with my career switch,\u201d she said.\n\n<b>A BOOMING FIELD<\/b>\n\nThe Seattle area has experienced record job growth in recent years, as companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Tableau and Starbucks have added thousands of employees.

In high school, Steiger had participated in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.museumofflight.org\/was\">Washington Aerospace Scholars<\/a>, a Running Start program giving juniors the opportunity to take college-credit STEM courses through a partnership between the UW and the Boeing.\n\n\u201cI was pretty proud to be a part of that,\u201d Steiger said. \u201cI was excited about engineering. I wanted to go into aerospace engineering.\u201d\n\nAnd then in an instant everything changed.\n\n\u201cIt was a seventy-mile-per-hour car crash,\u201d Steiger said. \u201cI was driving with my father to campus, and I got hit from behind \u2014 and in front. The car was completely totaled. I don\u2019t really remember much. Just waking up and seeing that my dad was unconscious.\u201d He and his father were taken to Harborview, where Steiger was diagnosed with a concussion.\n\nHe was taking multivariable calculus, and it was time for his midterm exams. But he found he couldn\u2019t do it anymore. His short-term memory had been damaged. \u201cIt turned out that I had a traumatic brain injury,\u201d he said.\n\nSteiger\u2019s neurologist told him he had the short-term memory span of 1 percent of his age group. Which meant he had to leave school. \u201cI spent a year doing speech therapy to regain my memory, similar to the way a stroke patient would rewire their brain,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt was very, very challenging and emotionally exhausting.\u201d\n\nAfter that year of rehab, Steiger was able to return to the UW, but he was unable to continue in engineering. Instead, he completed a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science. \u201cI just wanted to graduate with the hope that I could go back to school later and that my undergraduate degree wouldn\u2019t define me,\u201d he said.\n\nTESTING THE WATERS WITH A CERTIFICATE PROGRAM\n\nOver the next couple years, Steiger continued recovering. He relied on his soft skills as he worked in sales, and as his memory improved, he moved into finance. In time, he realized he had a knack for understanding business problems and felt ready to pursue a new career.\n\n\u201cI really wanted to develop some hard skills,\u201d Steiger said, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t know where to go.\u201d He decided a good first step would be to enroll in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pce.uw.edu\/certificates\/business-intelligence-techniques-for-decision-making\">Certificate in Business Intelligence: Techniques for Decision Making<\/a> from UW Professional &amp; Continuing Education, a branch of UW Continuum College.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t an easy step for him to take. \u201cI was worried about not doing well,\u201d Steiger explained. \u201cGoing back to school was a big deal for me.\u201d\n\nFortunately, Steiger discovered that he was able to do the work, which included using data analytics software applications and statistical programming languages. He also made another discovery: \u201cI found out that I really did enjoy it,\u201d he said. \u201cFinding exactly what I wanted to do was also a big deal.\u201d\n\nThe technology and methods Steiger learned in the certificate program have helped him advance in his career \u2014 he\u2019s currently a revenue management analyst for a cruise line \u2014 and have given him the confidence to pursue a new dream.\n\n\u201cI want to go back for a master\u2019s, and data science is something I\u2019m really considering,\u201d Steiger said. \u201cI\u2019m really motivated to move to the next level.\u201d"},{"title":"In pursuit of a dream","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/in-pursuit-of-a-dream\/","tags":["alumni","continuum-college","giving","pce"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"Tolulope Daramula grew up with a hunger to learn.

Then he decided to work smarter instead of harder.\n\nOne of 10 inaugural recipients of a UW Certificate Scholarship, Jeremiah knew that education was the path to a better life for him and now 11-year-old Jameel. He\u2019s weathered a spate of homelessness, financial instability and humbling appeals for help along the way.\n\nWith a Harvard- and UW-educated father and a librarian mother, Jeremiah and his six siblings grew up understanding the value of going to college. Jeremiah set his sights on an engineering degree at a private school in Florida after graduating from Seattle\u2019s Garfield High School, only to see his college career cut short by financial issues after just one semester.\n\nHe returned to Seattle and took some business courses at local community colleges \u2014 until fatherhood came his way.\n\n\u201cI was young, and I became more concerned about making money than continuing my education,\u201d Jeremiah recalls. \u201cMy dad had been away from the family a lot while he was going to school. I didn\u2019t want that for my son.\u201d\n\nServing up drinks and conversation over the next decade to high-tech workers from companies like Microsoft, Amazon and Expedia, Jeremiah listened intently as they talked about their work. Inspired, he decided to enroll in an intensive four-month training program to become a computer coder.\n\n\u201cI felt I had to do more. I wanted to learn, learn, learn. I wanted to work smarter, not harder,\u201d recounts Jeremiah, who doubled up on bartending shifts to save enough money for the full-time coding program.\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t save quite enough, and he and Jameel wound up sofa-surfing among friends or renting a cheap spare room in a stranger\u2019s house. It was a tough time, \u201cbut I thought it was important for my son to see me with my spirits up and my eyes on a goal,\u201d Jeremiah says.\n\nWhen he found himself still $4,000 short on tuition for the program, he swallowed his pride and established a GoFundMe page that somehow caught the attention of a local e-commerce executive. After one informal coffee meeting, the exec offered to pay Jeremiah\u2019s tuition in exchange for a four-month internship once the new coder graduated.\n\nThe internship lasted just two months before the company, Mercutio, offered Jeremiah a full-time job that has further stirred the ambitions of the newly minted high-tech worker.\n\n\u201cMy job is front-end development, but I see and hear other people at work talking about how they\u2019re driving decisions and it\u2019s all based on data analysis,\u201d he explains.\n\nThe UW certificate program in data analytics would broaden Jeremiah\u2019s skills and career potential.

The tech industry was reinventing design. Customers didn\u2019t just pay for the new PCs, they were also the end users who used computers every day. Demand was high for Ramey\u2019s expertise in computer documentation and usability testing, so she decided to help launch short courses in technical communication. To do this, she partnered with the Educational Outreach unit at the University of Washignton \u2014 now <a href=\"https:\/\/www.continuum.uw.edu\/default.aspx\">UW Continuum College<\/a>.\n\n\u201cOffering those short courses built our reputation \u2026 because we were engaged in educating people to practice a profession,\u201d said Ramey, now an emeritus professor of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hcde.washington.edu\/\">UW Department of Human Centered Design &amp; Engineering<\/a>. \u201cThat kind of outreach was enormously important.\u201d\n\nWhen budgets were slashed in the 1980s, the UW technical communication program took a hit. It was removed from its academic home in the College of Engineering, but the short courses lived on \u2014 and thrived. The program re-emerged as its own Department of Technical Communication in 1991, built in part on the success of its short courses.\n\nMASTER\u2019S DEGREES: A MATTER OF PARTNERING\n\nWithin the decade, Ramey said, the \u201cemergency of the web\u201d drove market demand for a master\u2019s program. Professionals didn\u2019t want to quit work for school, but, to keep up, they needed advanced skills, like technical writing and design. A lack of state funding for more instructors made it the right time to pivot.\n\n\u201cIt was a matter of partnering,\u201d Ramey said. \u201cThe idea for offering degree programs at night originated with continuing education,\u201d shorthand for Continuum College.\n\nThe master\u2019s in technical communication was a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hcde.washington.edu\/ms\/admissions-faqs\">breakthrough on two fronts<\/a>. First, it welcomed professionals to earn their degree part time or in the evenings. And, from its very first year, it paid for itself with tuition and fees \u2014 not state funds.\n\nThe program\u2019s popularity and revenue brought enthusiastic support from university administrators. And, with funding not tied to state rules, instructors could move fast to shape the curriculum for the changing industry.\n\nThe faculty, Ramey said, had \u201cmore authority, more power over our own future \u2014 our own direction \u2014 than we perhaps\n\nhad before.\u201d They aligned the curriculum to make sure education was consistent across the day and evening master\u2019s programs, but they knew not all students could commit to the full two years.\n\nThe next move: Certificates.\n\nSO MUCH MORE FOR STUDENTS\n\nAs the department evolved into what\u2019s now HCDE, it launched a series of professional certificates. The noncredit courses in technical writing and editing, global communication, and the current <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hcde.washington.edu\/ucd\">Certificate in User-Centered Design<\/a> taught a subset of the regular master\u2019s degree curriculum. These certificates offered a flexible option for full-time professionals seeking theory, tools, techniques \u2014 and career-advancing credentials.\n\n\u201cIt gave them a kind of power that they, with all their native intelligence, hadn\u2019t yet been able to really bring to bear,\u201d Ramey said. \u201cSo many of them advanced in their careers. These are people who are committed to improving the world for their users.\u201d\n\nTaught by UW professors, as well as top CEOs and tech leaders from around the region, the certificates quickly built a reputation for excellence. Surging enrollment mirrored the growing tech industry, attracting professionals from upstart tech companies, as well as from established leaders like Microsoft and Boeing.\n\n\u201cYou can't snow people about quality, certainly not in Seattle,\u201d Ramey said. \u201cWe were really very earnest about maintaining the quality of the program, very nervous about sustainability and very reliant on the Continuum College back-office operations to make it work.\u201d\n\nThe department replicated its success: The certificate programs were self-sustaining.\n\n\u201cThis was a way for us to do so much more for our students, and at the same time, advance our standing in the University,\u201d Ramey said. \u201cEverybody was happy about that.\u201d\n\nMASTERING COMPLEXITY\n\nFrom the short courses of the 1980s through today\u2019s degree and certificate offerings, Ramey credits program managers, now part of UW Continuum College, for understanding the academic department\u2019s potential and guiding the department through every stage of growth.\n\nThe department\u2019s success has inspired dozens to follow, including the leading <a href=\"https:\/\/mhcid.washington.edu\/\">Master of Human-Computer Interaction + Design<\/a> \u2014 an innovative collaboration by the Departments of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hcde.washington.edu\/\">Human Centered Design &amp; Engineering<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cs.washington.edu\/\">Computer Science &amp; Engineering<\/a> along with the <a href=\"http:\/\/art.washington.edu\/design\/\">Division of Design in the School of Art + Art History + Design<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/ischool.uw.edu\/\">Information School<\/a>.\n\nAs collaborations grow, so does complexity. With every course, academic departments focus on sharing expertise with learners, and UW Continuum College manages the rest: budgeting, enrollment projections, marketing, student finances and more.\n\n\u201cAcademics tend to be somewhat conservative in their understanding of how to deliver education, and it can be scary to get into that kind of startup mentality,\u201d Ramey said. \u201cWithin Continuum College, they have people who specialized in various disciplines. They can offer that resource of drawing on people who have knowledge of what works.\u201d"},{"title":"Bringing fun into engineering","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/bringing-fun-into-engineering\/","tags":["engineering","continuum-college","faculty"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Professor Wei-Chih Wang inspires high school students to flourish by discovering engineering and design solutions.","content":"(College Continuum, November 2016)\n\nWEI-CHIH WANG\u2019S STORY\n\n<b>PROFESSOR WEI-CHIH WANG INSPIRES HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO FLOURISH BY DISCOVERING ENGINEERING AND DESIGN SOLUTIONS FOR THEMSELVES.<\/b>\n\nFun. Spontaneous. Collaborative. Not words you\u2019d likely associate with summer school, let alone engineering class.

They bounce ideas off each other and work together to build things, like robots out of Legos and moving limbs from alloy. Sometimes Wang even leaves spare parts around the classroom \u2014 like a heavy flywheel that might come in handy during an engineering-inspired game of tug-and-war \u2014 to encourage students to look around and improvise.\n\n\u201cFor me, design means you give them the rough idea, then give them a bunch of tools, and let them figure out how to put everything together. That\u2019s what I call design,\u201d Wang explained. \u201cThat\u2019s the fun part of it.\u201d\n\nYet for some students, all this fun can add up to serious results.\n\nFROM SUMMER PROJECT TO UNIVERSITY-LEVEL ASSISTANT\n\nJonathan Leang, now a computer engineering and bioengineering major at UW, took Wang\u2019s class the summer before his junior year in high school. \u201cIt\u2019s not just what you learn about in class, it\u2019s the people you meet,\u201d Leang said. \u201cAnd meeting Dr. Wang has definitely changed my life.\u201d\n\nWang, always on the lookout for students with an especially bright spark of curiosity, spotted Leang\u2019s enthusiasm during the first project, building a robotic hand. Unsatisfied with good enough, Leang kept searching for ways to make his hand better \u2014 adding foam to create joints and taking the time to connect the wires together. \u201cThe detail he put in and the thought process seemed to me to be very mature thinking,\u201d Wang noted.\n\nAfter class, while Leang was waiting for his mom to pick him up, Wang asked if he wanted to see the Micro Technology Lab, which Wang directs, and maybe work in it as an assistant.\n\n\u201cIt was like no experience I\u2019d ever been presented with before,\u201d said Leang. \u201cThe class was something else already, but to be able to work in a university-level research lab. That was, frankly, mysterious and exciting to me.\u201d Leang admitted he even did a little happy dance after he left Wang\u2019s office. \u201cI was thinking that don\u2019t know what I just got into, but I think it\u2019s pretty good.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo one project after another, Jonathan started doing so many projects with me I can\u2019t keep up with him!\u201d Wang said laughing. The two reminisce about accomplishments you\u2019d expect from a graduate student, not a high schooler \u2014 the joystick project they published a paper on, the underwater camera project they presented at the OCEANS conference, the SPIE conference where Leang presented further developments on the joystick. \u201cWe published two papers that first year,\u201d Wang said. (A number that\u2019s now up to five.)\n\nA FUTURE IN ENGINEERING\n\nLeang\u2019s experience as Wang\u2019s student and assistant has added fuel to his desire to become an engineer.

Beginning in 1912, the unit launched correspondence courses for the UW. And eventually in 2012, they became one of the first public university partners to offer a Massive Open Online Course, or MOOC, with Coursera.\n\nNow, Continuum College works with a range of UW faculty to build and administer MOOCs, offering instructional design, project management and video and audio production resources. The courses are published on the Coursera or edX platforms.\n\nTHE MOOC THAT GOT EVERYONE TALKING\n\n\u201cWithout Continuum College, I would not have been able to have my first MOOC. And I wouldn\u2019t be working on all the MOOCs I\u2019m working on now. It\u2019s been a very productive relationship,\u201d said Matt McGarrity, Principal Lecturer in the UW Department of Communications. McGarrity\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/public-speaking\">Introduction to Public Speaking<\/a> ranks in the top 50 most popular free MOOCs of all time, according to enrollment analysis by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.onlinecoursereport.com\/the-50-most-popular-moocs-of-all-time\/\">Online Course Report<\/a>.\n\n\u201cAt this point, I've had close to a million people go through the course,\u201d McGarrity said of his public speaking MOOC. \u201cThey're coming from everywhere, hundreds of countries.\u201d Many students have been from the United States, but the majority are from all over the globe, including a high representation from India, China, Brazil and Spain.\n\nAccording to McGarrity, the majority of the students have undergraduate or advanced degrees. They\u2019re taking his course for professional development or for their own public outreach in their area of expertise, such as the sciences.\n\nREACHING A GLOBAL AUDIENCE\n\nBy all counts, McGarrity\u2019s three-year-old MOOC is a smashing success. Enrollment numbers remain high, user ratings are excellent and students express gratitude and enthusiasm for the course in reviews. But the students aren\u2019t the only ones benefiting. Teaching the MOOC has made a difference in McGarrity\u2019s life as well.\n\n\u201cFrom a scholarship standpoint, having to think so much about a global audience has changed the direction of my study of public speaking,\u201d McGarrity explained. \u201cBefore doing the MOOC, I would look at public speaking within the American tradition and maybe within the British tradition. Now my thinking is about what works in a global sense.\u201d\n\nThe MOOC\u2019s popularity has also led to more opportunities for McGarrity to do in-person educational outreach, something he was already participating in. \u201cI consider it an important role of a public university to be able to spread and disseminate knowledge,\u201d he said, \u201cand the MOOC seemed to match up not only with the public outreach I was doing around the state but also what I thought the university would be interested in.\u201d"},{"title":"Embracing challenges and change","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/embracing-challenges-and-change\/","tags":["alumni","college-of-education","continuum-college"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Going back to school later in life is always challenging, and the experience of Nicole Traore, a graduate of the Early Childhood and Family Studies degree program, certainly reflected this fact.

I've been a teacher in the past and this is the other side, working with the families.\n\n<b>Will completing your bachelor's degree offer you opportunities for career growth?<\/b>\n\nWhen you get your degree, it changes the way you think about things. I'm in family support now and I absolutely love my job, but I can see other avenues. I feel like I have more to offer, more to give by completing my degree. I would love to go back into the classroom to be a lead teacher.\n\nThe whole field of early childhood education is changing and growing. This degree provides me more opportunities at a higher level than where I am now.\n\n<b>What was the best thing about the program for you?<\/b>\n\nWhat I learned. I've always thought that I really knew this field, but I can definitely use what I learned in the classroom. It provided practical information and new techniques that are cutting edge; it's supported by the best research, the best practices for preschool children and their families.\n\n<b>Part of the program involves taking and watching videos of yourself teaching. What were those like?<\/b>\n\nI learned so much from doing them. You get to see the way the kids see you\u00a0\u2014 you learn exactly what you're doing right or what you need to improve on. What I learned about how to engage students in the classroom was really important.\n\n<b>Did you get good feedback on the videos?<\/b>\n\nYou're in a group with two other students, known as the CORP (Community of Reflective Practices) group. When they reviewed my videos, they gave me feedback. At the end of the quarter, we submitted what we felt were our best videos to the instructors.\n\n<b>What was the online experience like for you?<\/b>\n\nWhat's different with an online classroom compared to a regular classroom is those lectures are online the entire quarter. Whenever I felt like it, I could go back to a lecture and review it.\n\n<b>Was the technology used in the program difficult to figure out?<\/b>\n\nThe technology is very simple. They give you a list of what you need to get, and it's really easy to figure out how to use it. If you had a problem, the technology department was right there\u00a0\u2014 there's a phone number that you can call.\n\nI never had problems with the learning platform. It was always there, always on, always available. It was really dependable.\n\n<b>Was the cohort aspect of the program important to you?<\/b>\n\nIt's important because you're building relationships and the trust is there. When someone was commenting on my video, I knew where they were coming from because I have worked with that classmate before. You start to really understand your classmates and their views about the field.\n\n<b>Can you tell us about what the instructors brought to the program?<\/b>\n\nThey're amazing. If there was anything that I didn't understand or if there was an issue, they were there for you. They partnered with you. They understood that most of us were working full time. One time I posted something on a Sunday night and both instructors responded right away.\n\n<b>What would you say to someone who's thinking about taking this program?<\/b>\n\nBeing a parent and working full time, I wondered how I could possibly go back to school. Even though I really wanted to, it was very scary. My philosophy was, I will never know if I don't try it out. I would say try it\u00a0\u2014 it's not as hard as it might appear."},{"title":"From the army to Amazon and beyond","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/from-the-army-to-amazon-and-beyond\/","tags":["alumni","continuum-college","department-of-civil-and-environmental-engineering"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Chelsea LaPlante knew she would eventually move from her logistics role with the U.S. Army to a civilian job.

I tried to attend as many optional program events as possible, because it gave me the opportunity to forge friendships and get to know people with similar goals and backgrounds.

And the Residency Week in the beginning of the program really set the stage for coordinating and working with cohort members.\n\n<b>What were the faculty like?<\/b>\n\nThe faculty are a treasure trove of knowledge and experience, and you can see their passion, drive and expertise.

After graduating from the program including earning a master's degree, she worked as an assistant principal in the district at Salmon Bay and Denny International before securing her self-described dream job as principal of Aki Kurose Middle School in 2008.\n\nUnder Williams\u2019 leadership, Aki Kurose has been recognized for fostering student growth and achievement and closing opportunity gaps. She has received several awards, including being named the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.awsp.org\/awspdocuments\/Mia_Williams_Middle_Level_POY_2016.pdf\">2016 Washington State Middle Level Principal of the Year<\/a>\u00a0by the Association of Washington School Principals. In this interview, Williams talks about how the core values of the Danforth program helped shape her as an administrator and still guide her day-to-day work.\n\n<b>Why did you choose Danforth, as opposed to other principal preparation programs?<\/b>\n\nThe selection process was rigorous, and I think that's different from most programs. I actually applied to the cohort the year before mine and was not admitted. It was kind of a challenge \u2014\u00a0I wanted to get in, so I just had to buckle down and refocus. And it was a great teachable moment for my students too, to know that this was something that I was going to continue to go after.\n\nI was told that you could get your credentials to be a principal from anywhere. But I really wanted to be a part of this program. I loved the cohort model and I really, really loved the solid core values mission of equity and excellence for all kids.\n\n<b>Can you explain how Danforth's emphasis on core values drew you to the program?<\/b>\n\nI think for school systems to be successful all stakeholders need to be grounded in common core values. And my core values are aligned with those of the Danforth program. I think equity and excellence is a big part of the social justice focus of Danforth, and just being student centered, being in a collaborative, data-driven process and having the different modules that help lead there.\n\n<b>You mentioned the cohort model that Danforth uses. Can you explain what that brings to the experience?<\/b>\n\nThere are relationships that are built through the work that you do together. Your learning is always more enriched when you're working in a group. And you know that everybody who's a part of Danforth has already bought into the core values and has the same message. People came to the program from all over, but we were all there for the same reason \u2014\u00a0and I think that that was powerful.\n\n<b>Do those relationships with your cohort and other Danforth alumni persist after you graduate?<\/b>\n\nYes, they do. You know you can reach out to each other all the time. It's just great because there's already that open door and you have a resource to call, or even for future jobs or other things like that.\n\nOne member of my cohort is at Harvard University now, so when I got to go to Harvard with four colleagues from Seattle last June, I was able to pick her brain about best practices in education. She's doing some wonderful work at a higher level so I wanted to touch base with her, and it's really enriched what I'm doing. There are people from Danforth all over, even in other states and countries. So I always have somebody to reach out to to stay on top of things.\n\n<b>How is Danforth's integrated internship structure helpful?<\/b>\n\nThat's another thing that really drew me to the program. In a lot of other programs, you do the coursework first and then you do your internship. I really liked that in Danforth you were doing the coursework and having class modules right in the midst of doing the internship work, so you can actually bring the real-time experience together and get coached through. We can cover problems of practice and the critical frames of our cohort model, and we can draw on each other's first strengths. I really think that's powerful.\n\n<b>Danforth is an intense, one-year program. How were you able to balance all your various responsibilities during that year?<\/b>\n\nThe cohort model works well because you have your study groups together, so you can have help with the academic side of it \u2014 you really have your cohort to lean on. And the teachers and instructors were so open; I feel like it was a deeper relationship. They know you so well, you could call them and say, \"Hey, this is what's going on,\" and they work with you. I think it was intense for those 16 months, with getting my masters and all of that, but it was well worth it. And it makes it seem more real, because in this leadership role you have to figure out how to balance.\n\n<b>What was the best thing about Danforth for you?<\/b>\n\nI think it's the whole premise of core values. Danforth makes you dig deep within yourself, to really hone in on doing the thoughtful things that are going to push you as a leader. There's just some basic core values that you're so grounded in as a leader. So whenever I'm faced with a decision I ask, \"How does this impact children?\" As a leader, it's helped me in my work every day."},{"title":"Prepared to lead","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/prepared-to-lead\/","tags":["alumni","college-of-education","continuum-college"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"Duke Truong and his family moved from Vietnam to Seattle when he was in the fourth grade.

These weren't challenges that a technical solution could easily be applied to, but authentic, organic challenges. We spent quality time focusing on the struggle to provide the best education possible and to support students who need a lot of social-emotional support.\n\nIt was very impactful for me. I've learned so much about who I am as a person and my beliefs for what education can provide for all students.\n\n<b>So you feel that Danforth was good preparation for the job?<\/b>\n\nAbsolutely. I don't know if there is one best way to prepare you for all the things that come at you as principal. But the strategies of how to have those difficult conversations when they come up in the moment, how to organize your time and how to make the most out of your classroom observations and instructional conversations with teachers \u2013 there were a lot of pieces that tied into the logistics of the job that prepared me well for walking into my current position.\n\n<b>What were the Danforth instructors like?<\/b>\n\nThey were fantastic, very attuned to our needs as a group. For example, while the instructors clearly had a plan, if our conversation led toward a specific part of the lesson, they immediately adjusted the lesson to fit our needs. We felt important, like we were listened to and that the class was tailored for us. If you needed more input on an individual level, the instructors were readily available for discussion or just to lend an ear as you worked out your own pedagogy.\n\n<b>Did you find the integrated internship model in the program to be valuable?<\/b>\n\nYes, the internship was an integral part of the success of the program. Regardless of which course we were taking, we could find multiple components in the coursework that tied directly with our internships. For example, when I was taking the course on school culture, there would be an assignment \u2014\u00a0not an artificial assignment, but a real assignment \u2014\u00a0on what the school culture was at the site of my internship.\n\n<b>Was it difficult to balance all the responsibilities of the program, including class and the internship, as well as your regular job?<\/b>\n\nIt was very challenging, but I felt supported every single step of the way. We had mentors that came to our internship site on a regular basis. We were free to call them at any time and to talk about anything we felt we needed to. Also, we could connect and share experiences with other cohort members who were also interning, for example, in a middle school.\n\n<b>Do you think the Danforth experience will help you in your career over the long term?<\/b>\n\nDefinitely. Because you spend so much time with your cohort members, you feel very connected with them. There was also a tremendous network of support from previous cohort members who shared in the program's teachings and experiences.\n\nThe leadership skills that we learned could be applicable to anything in your job. Looking at all of your data before you make a decision, collaborating with other people \u2014\u00a0these are skills that I draw upon daily."},{"title":"Finding his calling, and a new job","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/finding-his-calling-and-a-new-job\/","tags":["alumni","arts-sciences","continuum-college"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Vince Savery wanted to finish his college degree and study environmental and social justice issues.

He was motivated by the chance to finish his degree and excited about the opportunity to study environmental and social justice issues.\n\nBut the ISS program opened unexpected doors for Vince. Previously a manager and shift supervisor in the transportation industry, he credits the program with helping him land a job doing environmental and community work at the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency. The position involves helping freight trucks meet federal emissions standards, improving air quality and boosting the health of people who live in industrial areas.\n\nWe talked with Vince about how the ISS program has helped change his career and his life.\n\n<b>Can you tell us a little bit about your background?<\/b>\n\nI've been a truck driver and mechanic since I was 19. When I was younger I spent a fair amount of time working, and then I went to community college and got an associate's degree.\n\nI have also volunteered with EarthCorps over the last few years, helping to lead groups restoring the Duwamish River, with the goal of improving estuary areas for migrating salmon. This work integrates past industrial use with community efforts to improve the environment and neighborhood livability.\n\n<b>What prompted you to go back to school to finish your bachelor's degree?<\/b>\n\nI've always wanted to do something more academic with my career. I have three trade school degrees, and I didn't want this experience to be another trade school. I wanted to explore non-trade aspects of learning \u2013 academic and ethical considerations, different ways of thinking about a given subject.\n\nOver time, I've found that I'm interested in the social aspects of environmental projects, so I thought this program was the perfect combination. As part of this program, I hope to complete a study on how the Duwamish River Valley, the Duwamish tribe and the Seattle industrial community can all work together.\n\n<b>How has the ISS program opened up new career options for you?<\/b>\n\nThe fact that I'm in this program has helped me get a new job with the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency. I work with truck drivers, getting them to take part in a grant program to recycle their old trucks and help them buy newer ones.\n\nI'm also working on clean air issues and social justice issues with groups that are operating the trucks, and with those living in the area where the trucks operate. The people that live in the industrial valley near the Port of Seattle and the Port of Tacoma are typically lower income. They have very little control over where they live and even less over the air quality in the area.\n\n<b>Did you need a college degree to get this job?<\/b>\n\nI think the agency was interested in hiring somebody who was a bit more educated than I would have been had I not been in the ISS program. They also wanted somebody who displayed an interest in social justice. I had the perfect combination of trade experience and training and was enrolled in a program with a social justice emphasis.\n\n<b>In the long term, what do you hope to gain from earning your degree?<\/b>\n\nI think it's going to help me be a better critical thinker, and hopefully a better speaker and better representative on these environmental and social justice issues. I want to be able to consider what the issues are academically, and to influence policy in a more productive way.\n\n<b>What is the online aspect of the program like for you?<\/b>\n\nI couldn't do this program without the online flexibility. At first I didn't know if I'd learn enough without having direct face-to-face interaction with the instructor. That's proven not to be true. At this point I actually prefer to take classes online, rather than in a bricks-and-mortar classroom.\n\n<b>Why do you prefer online classes?<\/b>\n\nThe discussion groups we have online are really dynamic, really cool. There are multiple voices, and I think that people are able to write more in depth. What we write is there to read over later \u2013 we're reading it and then thinking about it, processing it. And then we can respond in a way that's thoughtful. These are very addictive \u2013 the discussion gets very involved, more than it might in a one-to-one conversation.\n\n<b>Does the fact that this program is offered by the UW make a difference?<\/b>\n\nI've always wanted to attend the University of Washington.

The teachers made sure that the tests and assignments were convenient and posted early, so I could do assignments in advance. Also, I'm a single mom and have a nine-year-old daughter. We had the chance to sit down and study together. It was interesting for her to see me attend school online.\n\n<b>Were you able to connect with the instructors?<\/b>\n\nEven though it was online, I felt like I knew my professors. They were very flexible and available to talk if I needed help. I don't feel like I missed out on anything in a bricks-and-mortar school by attending ISS online.\n\n<b>What would you tell someone considering the ISS program?<\/b>\n\nI have recommended the program to everyone who's thinking about going back to school.

She moved, got a job, married and had two daughters. Then her husband was deployed to Afghanistan.\n\nIn 2013, the time was finally right for her to go back to school \u2014 but she wasn't sure how she could attend classes and maintain her busy schedule.\n\n\"Going to school locally would mean transportation time and late evenings after work,\" Traci said. \"I didn't see how I could do that because I still had a lot of responsibilities being a mom and a wife.\"\n\nThat's when she came across the online Early Childhood &amp; Family Studies degree program at the UW (now known as the Early Care &amp; Education program). The flexibility it provided allowed her to fit school into her life.\n\nIt took a lot of hard work, but Traci did it, graduating with her UW bachelor's degree in 2015. Finishing her degree meant a raise in pay, but she also noted how the program has improved her teaching and changed her outlook.\n\n\"I learned so many things I didn't know,\" she said. \"I've learned to identify and deepen my practices, and really challenge myself.\"\n\nHere, Traci talks more about the positive aspects of the program and how it helped her achieve a major life goal.\n\n<b>What prompted you to go back to school to finish your bachelor's degree?<\/b>\n\nIt's something I've always wanted to do, but I put it off. What finally motivated me to go back was that my oldest daughter just recently finished her bachelor's degree, and my youngest daughter is in preschool. It was perfect timing for me to look into finishing my degree.\n\n<b>Can you tell us a bit about your background and current career?<\/b>\n\nI started in early childhood education more than 20 years ago; I was a licensed in-home child care provider. Later, I had a job at Head Start as a child care assistant on the college campus on Maui. I now work at a center-based program here in Hawaii, as a teaching assistant in a class for 3- and 4-year-olds.\n\n<b>Why did you choose this degree program?<\/b>\n\nI started looking online and came across the University of Washington program. I saw that it was worth investing in. The adviser was very encouraging and personable\u00a0\u2014 I felt really supported from the get-go.\n\n<b>Did you have any reservations about taking an online program?<\/b>\n\nI was concerned about the quality. I really wanted a genuine student-instructor relationship, and I wanted to get hands-on learning experiences. By far, the UW exceeded my expectations.\n\nAlso, the technology was very much a concern\u00a0\u2014 I'm in my 40s. It was a great personal challenge for me. Now I'm much more confident with online technology; it's just an additional part of the learning process. I didn't let technology get in the way of this goal that I was waiting 16 years to complete.\n\n<b>What are the advantages of taking classes online?<\/b>\n\nOne plus, by far, is that it's very flexible. I'm a night person, and I could be on the computer when my family was asleep and I had quiet time. The other plus was the CORP [Community of Reflective Practices] group setup. We had lots of opportunities to get to know our classmates.\n\n<b>What did you value most about the program?<\/b>\n\nThe personal relationships that I formed with my classmates and my instructors. We had such a great, eclectic group\u00a0\u2014 in-home nannies, stay-at-home moms, teachers, administrators. We supported each other and gave each other feedback. The instructors were very informative and responded really quickly.\n\n<b>Will finishing your bachelor's degree be helpful in your career?<\/b>\n\nAt my school, you need to have a minimum of a bachelor's degree to be a lead teacher. Many of our lead preschool teachers have master's degrees. My bachelor's degree opens up employment opportunities, and now I'm pursuing my master's. It was my positive online learning experience with UW that gave me the confidence to pursue my master's degree."},{"title":"Getting ahead of the curve in data science","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/getting-ahead-of-the-curve-in-data-science\/","tags":["alumni","continuum-college","pce"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Keith Beggs was looking to upgrade his data analysis skills and earn a credential that would help accelerate his career.

We\u2019re tasked with upgrading and reinventing various IT capabilities within the federal government. I am focusing in the short-term on leveraging data science, machine learning and geospatial technologies to unlock new insights and analytical capabilities.\n\nWhat appealed to you most about the program?\n\nGood academic rigor, practical application of skills and industry best practices. The program hit a good, solid balance of those three things.\n\nAre you using skills you learned in the certificate program in your job today?\n\nYes. Model development, machine learning and also some core statistics around data science \u2014\u00a0I'm trying to solve problems in a better way using those techniques. In fact, I\u2019m using these skills currently in some internal innovation initiatives. My new skills expand the solution options I can envision and implement.\n\nI'm also using skills from the certificate program outside of what I'm doing professionally for work. For example, in the program we participated in online competitions through\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/\">Kaggle<\/a>, which is a platform for predictive modeling competitions. What I learned in the program allows me to actively participate and collaborate in various professional communities like Kaggle.\n\nWere there classes that stood out as particularly interesting or useful for you?\n\nEach of the classes had a different focus. The program helps build a foundation of core skills and then provides practical application.\n\nThere\u2019s a good blend of academic theory early in the first two classes. The last class, in particular, was very application focused. There's a really good balance of best-practice sharing, practical experience and also theory that was welded together. It resonated very well.\n\nDid you get hands-on experience using data tools and algorithms?\n\nYes, both. We had a lot of hands-on experience. The instructors showed us the practical reality of things as opposed to the theoretically pure and pristine data that always works. They gave us the opportunity to stub our toes in a safe way, which is very useful.\n\nThere are certain academic activities you can learn from a book, and there are certain practical applications you need to learn by doing. I don\u2019t want to have to spend 20 years to get relevant, deep experience. I can spend one year learning best practices and short-circuit a lot of that journey. It was helpful to get the best practices as well as the hands-on experience.\n\nWhat do the instructors bring to the program?\n\nThe instructors bring solid academic understanding of data science as well as good, practical experience solving challenging data science problems. They provide valuable feedback to unblock you and help you learn \u2014 you can talk with them to make sure you\u2019ve applied things correctly. That combination of practical application, practical experience and industry best practices is something valuable and unique.\n\nDo you feel earning the certificate will help your career in the long term?\n\nYes. There's direct applicability for me to do my current work better, but I'm also thinking several moves down the road. It\u2019s a little bit of unemployment insurance. Being current and learning relevant skills is a great way to be in demand.\n\nWhat would you say to somebody who's thinking about taking this program?\n\nJump in and explore the options. Initially, the landscape may be a little intimidating. But the program provides you with a practical, pragmatic foundation of knowledge that allows you to continually refine your plans and goals as you get more perspective and a deeper knowledge base."},{"title":"From translator to localization engineer","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/from-translator-to-localization-engineer\/","tags":["alumni","continuum-college"],"pillars":["innovation"],"image":"","excerpt":"After working as a translator and English teacher in Spain, Keely Byron decided to take the Certificate of Localization to expand her career horizons.

After finishing college she moved to Spain, where she worked as a translator and English language instructor. But she was starting to feel hemmed in by her career options.\n\nSo Keely began exploring other roles in the translation field and discovered the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pce.uw.edu\/certificates\/localization-customizing-software-for-the-world\">Certificate in Localization: Customizing Software for the World<\/a>. The program opened her eyes to the array of career opportunities in the field of localization \u2014\u00a0and opened doors to good jobs. \u201cBefore I had even finished the program, I was able to get interviews,\u201d she explained. \u201cI would say the program was very instrumental to getting a job.\u201d\n\nAfter earning her certificate in 2015, Keely landed a localization position with a translation company. Here, Keely talks about her experience in the program and the career journey it made possible.\n\nTell us a bit about your current job.\n\nI am a localization engineering specialist at a company in Boston called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.luz.com\/\">LUZ<\/a>. We specialize in life-science translation. Pharmaceutical companies and medical device companies submit their products or documentation to us for translation into different languages.\n\nI prepare source files for translation, which involves sometimes manipulating the structure of the file itself, and convert the file into a translatable format for linguists to work with. I also help develop tools to streamline the localization process and automate aspects of the workflow.\n\nWhat prompted you to choose the UW certificate program?\n\nI realized the certificate in localization could be a great opportunity to combine my love for languages with my love for technology and learning new systems.\n\nThe UW program was really great because it encompassed everything I was looking for. The first course gave a broad introduction to the localization industry. Next, it went into localization engineering, which really piqued my interest. Then it finished off with a project management course, which was also super helpful.\n\nWhat was it like taking the program online?\n\nIt allowed me to fit it into my schedule without having to uproot my life in Boston. The online format was easy to use, and those of us studying online could communicate with the professors and ask questions during class. Breakout sessions helped us interact with and work with students who were in the classroom or located in other parts of the world. This was a great networking opportunity, and it also gave me a glimpse into what it's like to work with a global team.\n\nDo you think earning the certificate was helpful in getting a job?\n\nIt was extremely helpful. It's one thing to have language skills, and even to have worked as a translator, but having an inside view of the translation process gives you a serious advantage. Employers notice that \u2014 that you're invested in the industry and you've put in the time to educate yourself about it.\n\nDid you have a software engineering background coming into the program?\n\nI had learned a little bit about coding and programming on my own, but once I realized how relevant it can be to localization, that's really what motivated me to look into it more. The localization engineering class is where I really started picking up programming and learning other coding that's relevant for localization, and I knew that was the direction I wanted to go.\n\nAre you using skills you learned in the program in your current job?\n\nDefinitely. We did a couple of workshops on Trados, which is a computer-aided translation technology that I use in my job every single day. I go back to my notes every so often from that class to look at how to translate different software files or to reference problem-solving exercises that we worked on in class.\n\nWhat did you find most valuable about the program?\n\nI entered the program not really knowing what I didn't know. Being able to open my eyes to all the different elements of the localization field \u2014 the technology used, the quality assurance measures, the relationships with linguists and vendor management \u2014 and how they fit together was really beneficial to my current career.\n\nWhat advice would you give someone who's interested in this program or in getting into this field?\n\nI would stress that there's so much with translation that people who aren't in the industry don't realize. There are so many different aspects of it. You shouldn't look at this program and think that you're locking yourself into one job. It really opens a lot of doors and there are a lot of different careers within the industry."},{"title":"Building a great career","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/building-a-great-career\/","tags":["alumni","continuum-college","pce"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"Getting the job you want can be tough, even in a booming industry like construction.

The combination worked well.\n\n\u201cThere were a couple different tracks to pick from in the information management master\u2019s program,\u201d he explained. \u201cI wanted to focus on risk management and information security. The three courses in this certificate program were aligned with that emphasis.\u201d\n\nToday, Justin works as a digital media analyst for the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team, part of the Department of Homeland Security. In this interview, he talks about how completing the certificate helped him develop a career in this increasingly vital industry.\n\nWhy did you change from film studies to information security?\n\nI know that's kind of an unorthodox switch, but I was researching a lot of technology and new media when I was doing that film studies program. I've always been interested in computers, and I decided that academia was not really my passion anymore. I wanted to switch fields, and I ended up landing on cybersecurity as a main focus.\n\nHow did the Certificate in Information Security &amp; Risk Management help you make this move?\n\nThe certificate program did a great job on several fronts. It laid a good foundation of information assurance and risk management background knowledge that anyone going into the field should know, regardless of their specialization. I expect to continue using that knowledge throughout my career. The program also brought in a lot of experienced professionals to help give you insight into different facets of the field.\n\nHow did the program help you break into the industry?\n\nMy first job experience was actually an internship with Homeland Security, which I did while I was still going to school. Then I did an internship with the City of Seattle in their information security office. What I learned in the certificate program was directly pertinent to the work I did in my internships. The governance and information security policy material was especially useful.\n\nBarbara Endicott-Popovsky was my adviser for the master\u2019s program, and she also heads the certificate program. It was through her professional connections that I got my internships. After interning for about a year, as I was finishing up my master\u2019s, I got the permanent job offer at Homeland Security.\n\nWhat do you do at the Department of Homeland Security?\n\nMy first position here was a policy-level job with the National Coordinating Center for Communications. I worked on disaster recovery and business continuity policy and planning, which was covered in depth in the certificate program curriculum.\n\nLast year I transferred over to my current position as a digital media analyst. We're in charge of investigating incidents, like network intrusions or malware incidents, that affect any of the federal departments and agencies. We get deployed in response to a computer security incident or we receive hard drives from a particular department that has a security breach of some variety and requests investigative assistance.\n\nYou took this program online. What was that experience like?\n\nI think the way this program is done online is about as good as can be. They use Adobe Connect, an interactive program where you can actually see the lecturer. You can see the slides in a separate window, and there\u2019s a chat window. It was synchronized, so it was live. You could participate just as well as if you were actually sitting in the classroom.\n\nHow\u2019s the job market for these skills? Is it a good time to enter the field?\n\nAbsolutely. It's a great field to be in because there\u2019s no shortage of need for it. Even at a federal level, every single individual department and agency has their own security capabilities and their own responders. Just like every major corporation has their own internal crew that handles this stuff.\n\nAnd the salaries are pretty high. These are probably among the highest-paid positions in the federal government.\n\nWhat would your advice be to people trying to break into the field?\n\nNetworking is crucial, especially in Seattle, which has a great community of people who have been doing this work for a long time. But first, getting a solid foundation in information technology is important \u2014 learn about the ins and outs of computer hardware and software, as well as network functionality and protocols.\n\nWhat were your biggest takeaways from the program?\n\nIt was the insight into the workings of real-world organizations and the challenges they face related to information security. And also how critical risk management is in any business decision."},{"title":"Taking data to new heights","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/taking-data-to-new-heights\/","tags":["alumni","continuum-college","pce"],"pillars":["innovation"],"image":"","excerpt":"When Victor Chinn's long-planned trip to Africa conflicted with his internet of Things certificate class, the teach executive decided to take his coursework with him \u2014 all the way to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro.","content":"(Continuum College, May 2017)\n\nLong before Victor Chinn enrolled in our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pce.uw.edu\/certificates\/internet-of-things\">Certificate in Internet of Things<\/a>\u00a0in early 2017, he and his wife had mapped out a trip to Tanzania to climb Mount Kilimanjaro. As it turned out, the trip and the program dates overlapped.\n\nVictor, an accomplished climber who\u2019s scaled Mount Rainier and other peaks across Washington, was excited to tackle the challenge of climbing the highest mountain in Africa. But he worried about the timing, knowing he\u2019d miss several classes of his first certificate course.\n\nHis instructor, however, saw it as an opportunity to take what Victor was learning in class to the next level \u2014 literally. Mount Kilimanjaro tops out at 19,341 feet.\n\n\u201cMy instructor suggested that I take a Raspberry Pi with me on my trip,\u201d Victor said, referring to the hardware device that students in the internet of things (IoT) program use for their assignments. \u201cI was surprised at how easy it was to do \u2014 it worked out really well.\u201d\n\nVictor was able to program his Raspberry Pi to connect with a satellite and measure different types of data on the mountain, like temperature, pressure and elevation. That\u2019s the power of the internet of things: The growing ability to access all kinds of data from anywhere, through just about any device, using the cloud.\n\n\u201cBringing the IoT sensors with me up Kilimanjaro opened up a new way to view that environment with quantifiable data and information,\u201d he noted.\n\nWe recently caught up with Victor and talked about his experience in Africa and how he might use what he\u2019s learned in the certificate program to elevate his career.\n\nFirst of all, how did the climb go?\n\nIt went great. My wife and I both made it to the summit successfully.\n\nCan you tell us about the connected device you used on Kilimanjaro?\n\nThe Raspberry Pi is basically a CPU with sensors. For this trip, we added an attachment called a Sense HAT, which has sensors that measure temperature, pressure and humidity and an LCD display to show the readouts. This device also connects to a GPS satellite to show where you are, including the elevation.\n\nWhy did you choose to take the IoT program?\n\nBefore the class, I didn't have a very good understanding of what the internet of things is. When I heard about this program, I grabbed it, because I wanted to jump into this field. I wanted to do a deep dive, and this course certainly met that expectation.\n\nWhat has your experience been like in the course?\n\nOne of the things that makes this class different from many others is the amount of hands-on learning that goes on. The \"things\" in the program title refers to the hardware that we\u2019re working on, including processors and sensors and all the electronics. These things can record or measure all kinds of useful pieces of information \u2014 temperature, humidity, pressure, location, heart rate. You end up with a powerful ability to measure anything you want that's digitally quantifiable.\n\nAnd the instructor has been excellent. I really like his teaching style; he brings a wealth of experience to the class. I think the class has been extremely fun. It reminds me of my childhood, when I was tinkering with electronics as early as the seventh grade.\n\nHow does the IoT certificate relate to your work?\n\nI own <a href=\"http:\/\/www.colbyinstruments.com\/\">Colby Instruments<\/a>. We make a very high-frequency, programmable delay line instrument.

When he developed a love for coding and software, he knew he's found his path. Read how the Certificate in Python Programming helped him to turn a passion into a new profession.","content":"(Continuum College, September 2017)\n\nWhile working in his family\u2019s custom cabinetry business, Rob Alford always enjoyed the creative aspect of the job and took pride in honing his craft. But when he and his wife started a family, he felt the time was right to make a career change.\n\n\u201cI wanted to take some time off to stay home with my kids, and I was ready to move on to a different field,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I decided to look for work that would give me a more flexible schedule, and a new challenge.\u201d\n\n<b>CHARTING A NEW COURSE<\/b>\n\nRob, who earned a degree in English from the University of Washington, had previously explored freelance writing as a possible career \u2014 a role that also tapped into his creative side. But he needed something that provided a steadier income and greater long-term growth potential. Then he uncovered a new passion.\n\n\u201cI started learning to code and build apps and websites while I was staying at home,\u201d Rob said. \u201cI had a few ideas for digital products I wanted to try out, and I found I really enjoyed learning about programming and software development.\u201d\n\nWith the Seattle tech boom creating an abundance of high-paying software jobs, he began contemplating a switch to that field. But Rob knew he needed deeper knowledge and more formal development experience. The question was how to get it. The answer was continuing education at the University of Washington.\n\n<b>FINDING THE RIGHT FIT<\/b>\n\nFor Rob, discovering a program that offered in-depth learning while also fitting in with his busy family life was key. He found that combination in the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pce.uw.edu\/certificates\/python-programming\">Certificate in Python Programming<\/a>.\n\n\u201cI looked at some coding boot camps and more traditional degree programs, but the UW certificate program was just a perfect fit for me,\u201d Rob said. \u201cI could space out my learning over the whole year and get comprehensive knowledge while working with my schedule. It gives you the flexibility to have a job or a life while you\u2019re doing it.\u201d\n\nHe also found a great fit with the Python language.\n\n\u201cI chose Python because it\u2019s a really versatile language,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s used in web development, and it\u2019s also heavily used in a variety of emerging fields such as machine learning and data science. If you\u2019re going to learn a programming language right now, Python is a great one to go with.\u201d\n\n<b>MAKING CONNECTIONS AND GAINING EXPERIENCE<\/b>\n\nBecause the Python certificate program features a cohort student model, Rob got a chance to work with his classmates throughout his courses. He found the group projects to be particularly valuable.\n\n\u201cOne of the best things about this program was the opportunity to work collaboratively with other people,\u201d he explained. \u201cAs a self-taught programmer, you never get to do that \u2014 and working professionally in the software field, that\u2019s a huge part of what you do.\u201d\n\nHis group project, completed with two classmates, was to produce a web application that helps building contractors find ways to dispose of waste material. \u201cGetting professional review from the instructors and getting that hands-on experience was really beneficial,\" he said. \"Working on the project really inspired me to pursue my goal of becoming a web application developer.\u201d\n\nRob also appreciated the personal support he received from his instructors, who helped him navigate the challenging career change.\n\n\u201cThe instructors were excellent. One in particular was there throughout the whole program, and she had experience both in academia and in the software industry,\u201d Rob noted. \u201cShe became a really great resource for me and gave me a lot of really helpful advice on interviewing and networking. I\u2019m still in contact with her.\u201d\n\n<b>LANDING THE JOB<\/b>\n\nShortly after he completed the certificate program, Rob accepted a position with Green Light Go, a web development and consulting agency in Seattle. His schedule there is flexible, offering him the work-life balance he was after.\n\nRob credits the Python certificate program with making the career switch possible.\n\n\u201cCompleting the certificate was probably the single biggest factor for me being able to get a job,\u201d he said. \u201cThe program is particularly helpful for people making a career change.\u201d\n\nThe <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pce.uw.edu\/news-features\/articles\/hot-jobs-web-developer\">market for software developers<\/a> is certainly booming today. Beyond making a good living, however, Rob also finds satisfaction in his work \u2014 and even the creativity that he\u2019s always sought professionally.\n\n\u201cProgramming combines what I love about my previous careers in writing and construction \u2014 the problem solving, the feeling of building something from nothing and the unique combination of creative and analytical skills you use when developing software. It\u2019s been a great move.\u201d"},{"title":"Teaching machines to teach themselves","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/teaching-machines-to-teach-themselves\/","tags":["alumni","continuum-college","pce"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Certificate in Machine Learning grad Elliot Stepusin used the knowledge he gained form the cutting-edge program to launch a great career in this rapidly growing computer science field.","content":"(Continuum College, October 2017)\n\nComing out of graduate school, Elliott Stepusin was able to land a job in data science \u2014 a field everyone is talking about these days. But it just wasn\u2019t the right fit.\n\n\u201cI was working with data for a school district, using Excel and other basic tools, but it wasn\u2019t the job I wanted,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cThe fun part of grad school for me was the math, the programming and problem solving.\u201d\n\nWhile doing some research, he found there was a discipline that better matched what he was looking for: machine learning. It\u2019s based on the idea that today\u2019s powerful computers can use sophisticated algorithms to continually refine how they analyze large data sets. To learn as they go, so to speak, in the same way that humans do.\n\n\u201cMachine learning is the term for how computers can discover patterns in data in order to learn more about a specific process or predict on that process in the future,\u201d Elliott explained.\u00a0\u201cOur society has a wealth of data and information, and we can leverage that information to improve the current processes around us and create new, unique solutions to problems.\u201d\n\nTo make the transition to this field, Elliott knew it would require more specialized training. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pce.uw.edu\/certificates\/machine-learning\">Certificate in Machine Learning<\/a> offered exactly what he needed.\n\n<b>SOARING JOB GROWTH<\/b>\n\nProfessionals with machine learning expertise are in huge demand. A recent search for \"machine learning\" on LinkedIn turned up more than 15,000 jobs in the United States, more than many other data-related positions.\n\nBecause the demand is so great, and the skills so specialized, compensation in the field is high. Job listings for machine learning on Indeed.com list a salary range of $80,000 to $130,000, depending on experience. Studies by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate the job market is growing fast. These studies also show the median salary of computer and information research scientists, roles related to machine learning, was $111,840 in 2016.\n\nFor Elliott, though, the appeal of machine learning goes beyond the job market or money.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the salary is a big draw for many people, but that\u2019s not what attracted me,\u201d he said. \u201cI really wanted to find something that was fascinating to me, something I could do for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\n<b>BRIDGING THE RESUME GAP<\/b>\n\nBreaking into machine learning would not be an easy task, Elliott realized. His background and work experience didn\u2019t match what employers were looking for.\n\n\u201cI have a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering, which seems way out of left field,\u201d he explained. \u201cI needed to get something on my resume that would bridge that gap, and I also needed to acquire some practical knowledge.\u201d\n\nHe decided getting another degree was not an option (\u201cI\u2019m definitely done with that level of education\u201d), but a certificate program would provide the practical learning \u2014 and respected credential \u2014 he was after.\n\n\u201cThe certificate was something of substance to put on my resume,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cI think that\u2019s definitely important. A certificate program really facilitates everything you need to do, in terms of positioning yourself in the marketplace.\u201d\n\n<b>CHOOSING THE UW<\/b>\n\nAfter looking at a few other programs, including those at Stanford and Harvard, he decided on the UW certificate program.\n\n\u201cI liked that the teachers were in the industry,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cIt's great to learn theory, but at the end of the day, what actually gets done on a daily basis is more important. I think the years of experience that they have, the very diverse backgrounds and job experiences, was really important.\u201d\n\nHe also benefited from the online format of the program.\n\n\u201cOffering a program online is great,\u201d he said. \u201cI really like the utility of being able to do the program anytime. And since I live in Chicago, I couldn\u2019t do it in the classroom.\u201d\n\nElliott considered doing a boot camp program, but he felt that the UW certificate offered greater depth.\n\n\u201cI like that the certificate program included three classes,\u201d he noted. \u201cSome of the other ones are shorter, but I actually prefer that it was nine months, because I thought it gave a little more validity to it.\u201d\n\n<b>ACCELERATING HIS CAREER PATH<\/b>\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Elliott\u2019s experience in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pce.uw.edu\/certificates\/machine-learning\">Certificate in Machine Learning<\/a> to pay off. In fact, he hadn\u2019t even finished his first course when he hit pay dirt.\n\n\u201cI actually applied to Crowe Horwath, the company I work for now, right out of graduate school,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI talked to the recruiter and he said, \u2018We're looking for someone with more machine learning knowledge \u2014 maybe two years from now you could come back and apply.\u2019 After I started the program, I reached out to him, and he set up an interview.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of technical machine learning questions in the interview, but all those things had already been covered in the class, which was nice. They pretty much offered me a job on the spot. I think I was two-thirds through the first course of the program at that point.\u201d\n\nEven though he had the job he wanted, Elliott decided to finish the certificate, graduating in 2017. He finds that what he learned continues to help him at his job today.\n\n\u201cThe types of things you do in class during the certificate program, those are the exact kinds of things I do at work now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have machine learning conversations and debates where I can use what I learned from my instructors and participate in a meaningful way.\u201d"},{"title":"For the love of games","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/for-the-love-of-games\/","tags":["alumni","continuum-college","pce"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"Trevor Harron turned his childhood passion for board and card games into a successful business with help from our innovative Certificate in Game Design.","content":"(Continuum College, November 2017)\n\nTrevor Harron has loved playing board games and card games since he was a kid.\n\n\u201cIt was a treasured family moment,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe would finish dinner, and then we\u2019d break out games like Five Crowns, Quiddler, and just play as a family.\u201d\n\nWhile Trevor grew up to be a software developer, his love of games \u2014 and the desire to create his own \u2014 never left him.\n\n\u201cIt was in the back of my mind that I wanted to make games,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut going from the \u2018I have a bunch of ideas\u2019 phase to the \u2018I have a physical game that I\u2019ve made\u2019 stage was something I couldn't really imagine doing on my own. I didn\u2019t know how the process worked.\u201d\n\n<b>MAKING IT HAPPEN<\/b>\n\nWhen Trevor discovered the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pce.uw.edu\/certificates\/game-design\">Certificate in Game Design<\/a>, he found a way to turn his game ideas into reality.\n\n\u201cThe lessons from the game design certificate prepared me for every step of production,\u201d he said, \u201cfrom the initial design to working in teams, coordinating work, playtesting, refining, taking feedback \u2014 and constantly improving along the way.\u201d\n\nWith this knowledge, Trevor was able to develop a prototype of his first game, Collectors and Capers. He describes it as a set collecting and bluffing game, \u201cgin rummy and poker mixed together.\u201d\n\nThen came the second \u2014 and potentially more challenging \u2014 part of the process: funding and marketing the game. So Trevor created a Kickstarter campaign, with some help from the certificate program.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know a lot about how to do a Kickstarter campaign, so the instructor put me in contact with someone who had gone through the process themselves,\u201d he noted. \u201cIt was a successful campaign, and now Collectors and Capers is being played in the United States, Germany, Singapore, Brazil and other places.\u201d\n\nThe Kickstarter funding helped Trevor pay off his initial investment, and he now pockets all the proceeds from each game sold. \u201cYou can make money from board games,\u201d he affirmed.\n\n<b>TEACHING THE FUNDAMENTALS<\/b>\n\nBoard, card and dice games, often referred to as tabletop or hobby games, aren\u2019t just a popular pastime \u2014 they\u2019re a big business. <a href=\"https:\/\/icv2.com\/articles\/news\/view\/38012\/hobby-games-market-over-1-4-billion\">According to an industry report<\/a>, sales of these types of games topped $1.4 billion in 2016 in the United States and Canada alone.\n\nVideo games and casual games on mobile devices are also a huge category, of course. But as certificate instructor Jay Schneider observed, the essential principles of compelling game design are the same for all platforms.\n\n\u201cIf we play a game of Monopoly \u2014 whether online, on our phones or around a table \u2014 we're playing the same game,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cIn the certificate program, we teach how to design that abstract game. The actual format you produce that game in, while a factor, is a secondary design aspect.\u201d\n\nTrevor hopes to someday develop mobile games or video games, too, and felt the certificate program has prepared him for that.\n\n\u201cRegardless if you want to do video games, mobile games, board games, a combination of both ... it doesn't matter,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will get all of the training, all of the skills, the rigor to make good games.\u201d\n\n<b>CREATING INDUSTRY CONNECTIONS<\/b>\n\nSeattle and the Puget Sound area make up one of the main hubs of the games industry, home to well-known companies like Nintendo, Valve, PopCap Games and Wizards of the Coast. There\u2019s also a large community of independent designers here.\n\n\u201cSeattle is the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me for game design,\u201d Trevor said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great area to be a game designer, because you have not only the UW program but also a massive community of people who are self-publishing, as well as small, medium and large game publishers.\u201d\n\nThis wealth of talent shows up in the quality of the instruction in the certificate program, Trevor said.\n\n\u201cThe instructors were tried-and-true veterans of the industry, who have been on great projects at big companies or small companies, or have worked by themselves,\" he observed. \"They brought all of that to the classroom in every lecture, every assignment, every bit of feedback.\u201d\n\nThe program also excels at connecting students with opportunities in the field.\n\n\"I owe a lot of my success to the UW game design program, and part of that is because of the connections I've been able to make through the instructors,\" Trevor said. \u201cThere\u2019s a number people I know from my class who have gone on to get jobs in the game design industry.\u201d\n\n<b>CHANGING THE WORLD, ONE GAME AT A TIME<\/b>\n\nBuoyed by the success of his first game, Trevor has created two more: Affectionate Cats &amp; Cuddles, a dice game \u201cabout cats being sweet\u201d that was inspired by the passing of one of his own feline friends; and Who Wears the Crown?, a card game \u201cto help resolve the issues people have with kings and king making.\u201d\n\nAnd while he hopes to be commercially successful with his game design business, Blue Heron Entertainment, Trevor also feels a higher calling in following his passion.\n\n\u201cI want to revolutionize the game world \u2014 with each and every game, I want to examine some part of humanity and the human condition,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe people play games to learn to challenge themselves, and to be with others.

Bags of beans and a dizzying array of coffee-brewing gizmos crowded his childhood kitchen.\n\n\u201cOne of my fondest coffee-specific rituals was sitting with my parents out on our back porch during weekends home from college, discussing the awesome rollercoaster of university life over a steaming pot of Sumatra,\u201d he says.\n\nNow Fellerman has taken his appreciation for coffee to a new level, managing regional operations for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vegacoffee.com\/\">Vega Coffee<\/a> in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.\n\nThe company holds a unique place in the coffee market. After buying coffee from farm cooperatives across Central America and South America, Vega trains coffee farmers to roast, grade, package, and sell their finished product directly to customers via their online store.\u00a0 Fellerman spent the past 18 months overseeing day-to-day roasting and export of the product as Vega\u2019s operations manager in Nicaragua. Earlier this month he relocated to Colombia, where he will provide on-the-ground support for a pilot project to expand Vega\u2019s reach.\n\n\u201cI think Vega\u2019s success has been the result of forming very authentic, reliable, and direct relationships with our farmer roasters and their families,\u201d says Fellerman, who spends about one-third of his time visiting farmers. Having the roaster located near where the beans are grown \u201caffords us multiple touch points and ultimately richer relationships with our farmer roasters.\u201d It also benefits the farmers tremendously: since participating in this new model, monthly incomes have increased up to fourfold in some cases.\n\nVega sought an operations manager with a variety of skills, including financial acumen, knowledge of coffee, fluency in Spanish, familiarity with Central and South America, and a willingness to work abroad. The role was seemingly tailor-made for Fellerman, tapping into skills he developed at the UW and beyond.\n\nFellerman\u2019s first experience living abroad was a three-month program at an international university in Perugia, Italy, during his junior year at the UW. \u201cI was the first UW student to attend the school since Amanda Knox was there in 2007, so a lot of eyebrows raised when I mentioned my Seattle provenance,\u201d he says. The experience whet his appetite for more travel, and led him to major in <a href=\"https:\/\/jsis.washington.edu\/\">international studies<\/a>. The following summer he participated in a three-week <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/studyabroad\/students\/getting-started\/programs-at-a-glance\/#exploration%20seminars\">UW Exploration Seminar<\/a> in Costa Rica, and \u2014 after a post-graduation internship with the Global Indexes unit at Russell Investments \u2014 he headed to Chile for a year to learn Spanish and teach English.\n\n\u201cBy the time I graduated, my regional and language interests had shifted from Europe to Latin America and Spanish, and I wanted to engage with that part of the world in a substantive way,\u201d says Fellerman. \u201cThat year in Chile was a game-changer for me. I learned a lot about myself through the lens of another people and another country. My host family became a second family, as clich\u00e9 as that sounds, and I developed a proficiency with the Spanish language and Latin culture that has helped me navigate future professional experiences in the region.\u201d\n\nFellerman still needed to bolster his business expertise, so he headed back to the U.S. and joined Linksbridge SPC, a consulting firm with an international focus. For nearly three years, he worked on global health analytics and strategy, supporting teams at the Gates Foundation and PATH. He followed that up with a fellowship with Kiva.org, the micro-lending website, where he served as an intermediary in Nicaragua to help manage the complex relationships between Kiva and its various in-country partners. Soon after, he was hired by Vega Coffee.\n\nAlong the way, Fellerman not only developed the business savvy and Spanish proficiency necessary for the job, but also an understanding of the roasting process. \u201cA few years ago I took my enthusiasm to a new level and started home-roasting, starting out tinkering around with a popcorn popper,\u201d he says. \u201cI would experiment with different roast profiles and offer them to my friends and colleagues for feedback. The equipment and scale of roasting at Vega are obviously much different, but conceptually I already had a foundation from which to work.\u201d\n\nThough Fellerman has now moved to Colombia to focus on Vega\u2019s pilot project there, he will continue in an oversight role for Nicaraguan operations. The ultimate goal is to empower the Nicaraguan team to become entirely self-sufficient. \u201cPhasing out my full-time Nicaragua-based role is a big step toward achieving that,\u201d he says.\n\nEventually Fellerman plans to move back to the U.S., closer to the friends and family he has seen less frequently while living abroad. Missing loved ones\u2019 big events, including weddings and birthdays, has been the most challenging aspect of international work. But Fellerman wouldn\u2019t trade the experience for all the coffee in, well, Nicaragua.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something so fascinating about interacting with the world through your vocation,\u201d he says. \u201cNot just through taking a vacation or sitting in your armchair theorizing about it, but actually involved with contributing to the positive economic outcome of a people or a country.

By 15, she was getting calls from the University of Washington.\n\nThe UW was one of the first universities that recruited McElvaine, who earned her bachelor\u2019s in sociology in 2017. \u201cI remember sitting in Coach Gallimore\u2019s office when I was a junior in high school and hearing her offer me a scholarship,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mom and I just looked at each other like, \u2018What? That\u2019s <i>huge<\/i>.\u2019 Someone cared enough about me doing something I loved that they were willing to support it so I could do it without any financial burden, and that\u2019s a massive privilege.\u201d\n\nFor McElvaine, soccer \u2014\u00a0not school \u2014 had always been her sole identity. When she became a Husky, that all changed.\n\n\u201cThe first time I saw myself as someone who could be good at soccer <i>and<\/i> scholarly was when I got to the UW,\u201d says McElvaine, a four-year defender for the Huskies. \u201cThe culture of my team and of the entire athletic department is that it\u2019s cool and important to do well in school. My athletic experience was only as valuable as how I supplemented it with my academics, and vice versa.\u201d\n\nAs an incoming freshman, McElvaine wasn\u2019t set on a major. She knew she liked talking about race and equity and social justice, but when she enrolled in Professor Alexes Harris\u2019 course \u201cRace and Ethnicity in the United States,\u201d she discovered that not only could she study these topics that were so personal to her, but there were other women of color already doing it.\n\n\u201cThat was the first time I\u2019d ever had a professor who looked like me, and that was transformative,\u201d she says. \u201cHer class is what sparked my interest in sociology and looking at these problems in a really scientific, pragmatic, critical way.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 23, 2016 \u2014 minutes before the Husky women\u2019s soccer team kicked off its season conference opener \u2014 McElvaine dropped a bare knee on the damp playing field of Husky Soccer Stadium as \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d rang through the loudspeakers.\n\nThe moment was inspired by San Francisco 49ers then-quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had opted one month earlier not to stand during the pregame national anthem. Instead he sat on the bench, arms crossed. It was a quiet response to a polarizing issue: police brutality against people of color.\n\nA movement took hold as athletes across the country sat, kneeled, raised fists and linked arms for their own causes, sparking a nationwide conversation about human rights.\n\nThe day before she took a knee, McElvaine had watched footage of the shooting of Terence Crutcher, a black man killed by a police officer in Tulsa, Oklahoma. \u201cI\u2019d seen a bunch of videos before,\u201d she says, \u201cbut with this one, I just couldn\u2019t get myself together. I couldn\u2019t control my crying.\u201d\n\nAt practice, McElvaine powered through her drills, but her coaches and teammates knew something was wrong.\n\n\u201cThe next day, before the national anthem, Coach Gallimore looked at me and said, \u2018Havana, if you want to kneel, you can,\u2019\u201d recalls McElvaine. \u201cI hadn\u2019t even thought about kneeling, but in that moment, she really knew me better than I knew myself. She enabled me to be in solidarity with a movement I cared about, and that was really powerful for me.\u201d\n\nA major priority supported by the UW\u2019s Race &amp; Equity Initiative, the movement for racial equity and social justice was also top of mind for McElvaine\u2019s teammates and other student-athletes. \u201cIt became apparent that we needed to initiate these uncomfortable conversations and build a community around these topics,\u201d she says.\n\nSo her team created a new culture where they opened up the floor and talked about <i>everything<\/i>, looping in coaches, administrators and academic advisers. \u201cIt was this really poignant time for all of us to be student-athletes and to have this platform and this space to talk,\u201d says McElvaine, who stepped into a leadership role as a senior and team captain.\n\nBut the poignancy ran even deeper for McElvaine. In her 21 years, she\u2019d always seen her identities as separate: On the field, she was a soccer player. In the classroom, a student. In her community, a champion for change. Now she was everything at once.\n\nDuring her four years at the UW, McElvaine learned about education and policy reform and public housing. She helped a professor track how children\u2019s perceptions of race and identity change over time. Then, for her senior honors thesis, she created her own research project, analyzing the impact that repeated video exposure to police violence and shootings has on black male college students.\n\nIn a series of focus groups with black men on campus, McElvaine asked them what it meant to see these incredibly violent incidents happening in real time \u2014 over and over again. \u201cThe conversations were heavy,\u201d says McElvaine, \u201cbut so important.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until she attended the 2017 Black Student-Athlete Summit in Austin, Texas, that McElvaine realized she didn\u2019t have a deep-rooted knowledge of the history of racial identity, despite spending every day talking and thinking about it. \u201cThere was this huge disconnect,\u201d she says. \u201cI have this really narrow understanding of black history not only in the U.S., but globally \u2014 the history of where I came from and why I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding black history became the inspiration for her Bonderman Fellowship: an eight-month donor-supported international journey designed to enable students to \u201cexplore, be open to the unexpected and come to know the world in new ways.\u201d\n\nIn January 2018, McElvaine will embark on a solo nine-country trip spanning North America, South America, Africa and Asia, tracing the African diaspora and the transatlantic slave trade as she connects with people around the world.\n\n\u201cI want to use this experience to immerse myself and learn all I can about black history globally,\u201d says McElvaine, the first Husky student-athlete to be awarded the prestigious fellowship. \u201cI want to answer questions like, \u2018Is my experience here as a black woman specific to America? Is it specific to me? Is it a universal experience? How do black women around the world think about race and equity and how those things interact with gender and activism and social justice?\u2019\u201d\n\nThen she hopes to bring what she\u2019s learned back home.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m most excited to see how other people are finding ways to build community and connect with each other, in spite of all the challenges happening around the world. Whatever work I go into, whether that\u2019s in athletics or some other sphere, I\u2019m excited to inspire change and fight for social justice.\u201d"},{"title":"Global Engineers","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/global-engineers\/","tags":["engineering","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Study abroad programs give students the opportunity to develop a global perspective.

With support from CEE, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/studyabroad\/\">UW Study Abroad<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/rome\/\">UW Rome Center<\/a>, he launched the program in 2013. It\u2019s now <a href=\"https:\/\/www.engr.washington.edu\/current\/study-abroad\">one of several programs<\/a> in which students can study abroad and earn engineering credits over the summer.\n\nThe program is open to students at all levels of study \u2014 from first-year to graduate students \u2014 and focuses on key topics in civil engineering through project-based experiential learning. Students study engineering theories and concepts in the classroom, travel as a class to sites where they observe and evaluate how such principles have been applied, then complete projects synthesizing their classroom learning and field observations.\n\nDuring the course, the students meet with local experts on Roman cities, archeology, construction, infrastructure and sustainability. This integration and exposure are critical parts of the program.\n\n\u201cEngineering as a field is increasingly an international and collaborative occupation, and programs like Engineering Rome can help set students up for successful careers in a global marketplace by exposing them to differences,\u201d Muench explains. \u201cAfter all, the most pressing environmental, health, and technological issues cross international boundaries \u2014 why shouldn\u2019t our students?\u201d\n\n<b>Global opportunities for future engineers<\/b>\n\nDesigned to maximize engineering student participation, Engineering Rome is offered every other year between UW\u2019s summer and autumn quarters. Students take part in a preparatory seminar that meets weekly on campus during spring quarter then travel abroad for four weeks in August and September.\n\nFor sophomore Agustin Castro, having an opportunity to get to know other students and become familiar with what to expect before traveling overseas was incredibly helpful. So was receiving a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/global\/gift\/\">UW Global Opportunities Scholarship<\/a>.\n\nAn industrial and systems engineering major with an interest in transportation planning and infrastructure, Castro was thrilled about the possibility of travelling to Europe to study Rome\u2019s Metro \u2014 an underground transportation system that has given engineers and archaeologists the unique challenge of navigating thousands of years of history anytime a new station or line is built. But he was reluctant at first.\n\n\u201cI thought I was going to have work all spring and summer to cover the cost of the program, but the Global Opportunities Scholarship made it possible for me to focus on school instead of worrying about the financial impact of studying abroad,\u201d Castro says.\n\nGriffin, also a scholarship recipient, agrees.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been able to travel to Rome were it not for the Global Opportunities fund,\u201d she says.\n\nGriffin and Castro believe that engineering students could also benefit from more understanding about why study abroad opportunities are relevant to engineering.\n\n\u201cGoing into it, I had no idea how much the experience would impact me,\u201d says Castro. \u201cIn addition to deepening my technical, research and communications skills, the program also boosted my appreciation of engineering history. It\u2019s one thing to read about engineering principles and projects in textbooks, but it's a much more meaningful experience to visit places where you can see such activity in action \u2014 or at least the evidence of it.\u201d\n\n<b>Course components<\/b>\n\nEngineering Rome\u2019s curriculum focuses on three themes: structures, water and sustainability. To complement in-class lectures and projects, students visit historical sites for real-world examples. At the Colosseum and Arch of Constantine, they observe and document classical Roman arches. Other locations, such as the Aqua Claudia aqueduct in Aqueduct Park (Parco degli Acquedotti), Trevi Fountain and the Baths of Caracalla, provide the class with an opportunity to expand their understanding of water flow and management.\n\n\u201cBeing able to visit places like the aqueduct systems instilled in me a deep appreciation of engineering from a historical perspective,\u201d says Griffin. \u201cConsidering the time period and the advanced capabilities of the aqueducts, I am in awe when I think about the skill, persistence and ingenuity of ancient engineers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that so many of these structures have lasted for so long \u2014 it\u2019s just so cool,\u201d adds Castro.\n\nWith more than 3,000 years of history and engineering feats accessible to visitors, Rome provides a unique setting to consider not just the contributions of engineers to infrastructure and society but also the concept of sustainability.\n\n\u201cMost students\u2019 ideas of \u2018sustainable cities\u2019 are influenced by contemporary engineering, but Rome offers a fascinating alternative: It\u2019s dirty, cluttered and old, yet it\u2019s survived for millennia,\u201d says Muench. In this way, he adds, it pushes students to think critically about perspective and difference.\n\nFor Griffin, these were some of the most valuable lessons.\n\n\u201cEngineers across the globe and throughout time have solved problems using a variety of approaches, resources and perspectives,\u201d she says. \u201cFor example, in the United States, when buildings become old, it\u2019s common to tear them down. But in many European cities, like Rome, they are built around or added onto. It\u2019s not that one way is better or worse than the other \u2014 they\u2019re just products of different cultures and perspectives.\u201d\n\nKnowing that such diversity exists in the field has made Griffin even more excited to be an engineer.\n\n\u201cThanks to my time abroad with Engineering Rome, I\u2019ve gained a greater awareness of and appreciation for diversity, and that\u2019s something I look forward to applying to other teams \u2014 in my classes at the UW and professional career after graduation,\u201d she says."},{"title":"Engineering for all","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/engineering-for-all\/","tags":["engineering","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"AccessEngineering is laying the groundwork for engineering programs to better serve more diverse student bodies \u2014 at the UW and beyond.","content":"(College of Engineering, November 2017)\n\nAccessEngineering is laying the groundwork for engineering programs to better serve more diverse student bodies \u2013 at the UW and beyond.\n\nUW students exchange ideas on how to make makerspaces more accessible to people with disabilities.

She also serves as president of the Washington Association of Blind Students and is actively involved with the UW <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/doit\/\">DO-IT Center<\/a>, an organization that supports students with disabilities nationwide through programs such as AccessEngineering.\n\n\u201cThanks to AccessEngineering and other DO-IT programs, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m pursuing my education alone, or that I have to figure out how to overcome obstacles that others don\u2019t have to by myself,\u201d says Werbel, who is legally blind. \u201cAccessEngineering is an incredible community of people committed to creating an education experience that\u2019s accessible to people of all abilities right from the start, instead of figuring out how to make accommodations after-the-fact or on an \u2018as-needed\u2019 basis.\u201d\n\nLaunched in 2014, AccessEngineering supports the development of a diverse, well-prepared workforce of engineering graduates and faculty by increasing the participation of people with disabilities. It\u2019s also working to improve engineering education by integrating disability-related and universal design content into engineering courses. The program is funded by the National Science Foundation.\n\n<b>Accessibility and universal design<\/b>\n\n\u201cWe were inspired by DO-IT and the Allen School\u2019s long-running <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/accesscomputing\/\">AccessComputing<\/a> program, which encourages and supports people with disabilities in computing programs and careers,\u201d says mechanical engineering assistant professor Kat Steele. \u201cWe wanted to extend similar ideas and resources to the broader engineering community.\u201d\n\nSteele is co-PI of AccessEngineering at the UW. Maya Cakmak, an assistant professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering, is also a co-PI. Sheryl Burgstahler, director of <a href=\"https:\/\/itconnect.uw.edu\/learn\/accessible\/atc\/\">UW-IT's Access Technology<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/doit\/\">DO-IT Center<\/a>, is PI of AccessEngineering.\n\nThey see AccessEngineering as a resource for universities nationwide, especially since ABET \u2014 the criteria for accrediting engineering programs \u2014 was recently revised to include accessibility. The program helps <a href=\"http:\/\/doit-prod.s.uw.edu\/doit\/programs\/accessengineering\/training-faculty\">train faculty<\/a> from across the country in universal design \u2014 designing devices, curriculum or environments that work for the widest possible array of people. Annually it hosts a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/doit\/resources\/capacity-building-institutes\">Capacity Building Institute<\/a> at the UW, and it <a href=\"http:\/\/doit-prod.s.uw.edu\/doit\/programs\/accessengineering\/get-involved\/apply-accessengineering-minigrant\">provides mini-grants<\/a> to help faculty and students incorporate universal design and accessibility principles into their courses and research.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/doit\/programs\/accessengineering\/overview\">AccessEngineering\u2019s website<\/a> houses dozens of materials, including checklists and guidelines for making engineering labs, departments, instruction, projects and computer labs inclusive of people with disabilities. Many of those recommendations \u2014 such as large print labels, adjustable-height desks, clutter-free workspaces, non-slip mats and clear lines of sight for demonstrations and presentations\u2014end up benefiting everyone.\n\n\u201cUniversal design is something we want to instill in engineers from Day One, and it doesn\u2019t just pertain to disability,\u201d says Cakmak.\n\n<b>Activities and engagement at the UW<\/b>\n\nLast year AccessEngineering brought together more than a dozen UW faculty, staff and students to develop curriculum that incorporates universal design and inclusivity into engineering classrooms. And the previous year, the program partnered with UW <a href=\"http:\/\/comotion.uw.edu\/\">CoMotion<\/a> to review and develop <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/news\/2015\/08\/05\/how-makerspaces-can-be-accessible-to-people-with-disabilities\/\">guidelines for accessible makerspaces<\/a>.\n\n\u201cMakerspaces are continuing to grow on university campuses, and we wanted to provide some best practices so that as these new spaces are being created they can be accessible to as many students as possible,\u201d says Steele.\n\nWerbel was one of the students who provided feedback and assessment on everything from signage and layout to equipment and organization.\n\n\u201cFor example, you know those bright yellow outlets that commonly hang from the ceilings in makerspaces and labs? They\u2019ve been designed to keep cords off the floor and prevent tripping hazards, which is great, but for me they\u2019re often at just the right height to be hazardous,\u201d she explains. \u201cEven though they\u2019re right in front of my face, I still can\u2019t see them because of difficulty with depth perception. And a cane doesn\u2019t pick them up because they\u2019re not on the ground.\u201d\n\nKnowing that her perspective may help shape the way institutions design makerspaces and allow for a more inclusive user experience has been very rewarding, she says.\n\nAccessEngineering supports other accessibility activities on the UW campus as well. One of these is <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/adaptuw\/\">HuskyADAPT<\/a>, a collaboration between Bioengineering, Mechanical Engineering and the Allen School that provides students with the opportunity to create accessible and affordable assistive technology through annual toy hacks and other outreach events.\n\nAccessEngineering also intersects with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/doit\/programs\/do-it-scholars\/overview\">DO-IT Scholars<\/a>, a program that helps prepare high school students with disabilities for college and careers. Cakmak, who works in the field of human-robot interaction, leads a weeklong summer camp during which high schoolers design, build and test assistive robots.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my favorite week of the year, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d she says. \u201cStudents with disabilities are excellent problem-solvers, because they have to solve problems all the time in their daily lives, and it\u2019s very inspiring to see what they come up with at camp.\u201d\n\n<b>Accessibility beyond campus<\/b>\n\nUltimately, the AccessEngineering leadership team hopes that the program will assist the UW and other universities in graduating more diverse and prepared engineers. The team has been concentrating efforts on raising awareness and building relationships with local companies and industry partners.\n\n\u201cCompanies like Boeing, Microsoft and Adobe have been great partners, and we\u2019re very eager to grow more relationships across industry,\u201d says Steele. \u201cThe more we can work with industry professionals and provide resources to help them create and support pathways for people with disabilities in their professional spaces, the more diversity we will have in the field.\u201d\n\nAnd just as universal design principles benefit everyone, so, too, does diversity.\n\n\u201cEngineers are problem-solvers, and because everyone comes to that process with different life experiences and priorities, the more diversity we have in engineering the more problems we\u2019ll be able to solve,\u201d she adds.\n\nLearn more about the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/doit\/\">DO-IT Center<\/a>, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, and how to get involved with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/doit\/programs\/accessengineering\/overview\">AccessEngineering<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/accesscomputing\/\">AccessComputing<\/a>."},{"title":"Doctoral student's mission: Training the great teachers of tomorrow","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/doctoral-students-mission-training-the-great-teachers-of-tomorrow\/","tags":["college-of-education","graduate-school"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"For the past decade, Weijia Wang has been on a journey to discover what makes an excellent teacher.\n\nThat journey started in China when, as a high school student, Wang heard reports that there was a large gap in teacher quality, especially in English, across the country.

Every doll Kellogg played with was black and every painting in her family\u2019s house was of a black person.\n\n\u201cI remember being quite perplexed at the idea of black being her favorite color,\u201d Kellogg said. \u201cNo one\u2019s favorite color could be black, right? I could not think of good things being associated with the color. I mean there is black ice and black cats, neither of which seemed very positive. Plus, as a young girl, I was socialized to believe girls\u2019 favorite colors were pink or purple and sometimes yellow or orange, but never black.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Kellogg was perplexed by her mother\u2019s focus. Now, the University of Washington College of Education graduate student recognizes how lucky she was to have a parent committed to identifying positive representations of black people.\n\nIt was her time at college, including a writing intensive course titled, \u201cWhat\u2019s Race Got to Do With It?\u201d that prompted Kellogg to begin considering a career in education.\n\n\u201cAs a sociology major, I was most interested in the intersections of race and equity in education. I was interested in how education can function as a means of mobilizing people and helping them achieve a higher standard of living.\u201d\n\nKellogg also served as the president of the Black Student Union, which provided first-hand experience creating community for all types of students, especially those from marginalized communities.\n\n\u201cThat experience taught me that it\u2019s OK to focus on black folks. As soon as you try to focus on one group, people will argue that \u2018All lives matter.\u2019 This is true, but sometimes we need to focus on specific marginalized groups.\u201d\n\nIn moving from the Midwest to the UW College of Education for her graduate studies, Kellogg hopes to be an example for younger students in her community that they have the potential to succeed wherever they choose to go.\n\nAs a first-year student in the <a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/programs\/graduate\/education-policy\">master\u2019s in education policy<\/a> program at the UW, Kellogg is focusing on community-based learning. In the spring and summer, she will participate in an internship aligned with her interests and the types of work she may do in the future. After graduating, she plans to return to the Chicago area and apply what she has learned in her program.\n\n\u201cMy big goal is to change the way that schools are funded in Chicago and the surrounding areas, so that every student has an opportunity to go to a school that has adequate, if not abundant, resources with the option to go onto higher education. Specifically, I hope to impact students of color and especially black students.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Kellogg would like to be a part of reforming K-12 curriculum to include historically marginalized voices. She wants to promote inclusion in school curriculum by assigning work that provides students with an opportunity to explore topics of race, gender and sexuality.\n\n\u201cI hope students become comfortable at earlier ages in engaging with how their personal identities shape the way that they learn. I am also passionate about seeing other black women thrive. I want to show black girls that there is room for all of us to win. I want them to think about who came before, recognizing their contributions to us and to our culture.

Their wooden sub, Knotty Dawg, won first place in the two-person competition at the International Submarine Races this summer.","content":"(College of Engineering, November 2017)\n\nThe UW Human Powered Sub Team has blended traditional boatbuilding with aerospace and marine engineering to create an award-winning submarine.\n\nAs far as self-powered submarines go, Knotty Dawg is a work of art: 15 feet long, its hull is handcrafted from western red cedar and finished with an African mahogany wood veneer. Standing next to it, one can\u2019t help but touch its smooth surface, trace the wood grains and admire the intricate design details.\n\nBut for the vessel\u2019s creators \u2014 members of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.uwhpsub.com\/\">UW Human Powered Sub team<\/a> (HPS) \u2014 it\u2019s more than just a visual wonder. It\u2019s an engineering accomplishment, one that paid off this summer at the <a href=\"http:\/\/internationalsubmarineraces.org\/\">International Submarine Races<\/a> (ISR) in Potomac, Maryland, where the team won first place in the fastest two-person sub competition with a speed of 3.27 knots.\n\n<b>A return to tradition<\/b>\n\n\u201cThis sub has been a return to tradition for us,\u201d says Andrew Farrell, a mechanical engineering senior and one of this year\u2019s HPS team captains.\n\nUW students started competing human powered submarines in 1989. They built their first hull from wood, but then moved on to foam, plastics, carbon fiber and other composites \u2014 materials used by most teams in the competition.\n\nThe idea to revisit wood as a medium came from former HPS captain Bentley Altizer, according to Farrell.\n\n\u201cBentley wanted to build something that would look great, give us a competitive edge and honor the heritage of wooden boatbuilding,\u201d he explains.\n\nLast year the team reached out to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nwswb.edu\/\">Northwest School of Wooden Boatbuilding<\/a> in Port Hadlock, Washington, an institution that teaches traditional and contemporary wooden boatbuilding skills. The school\u2019s boat builders were excited to learn about HPS\u2019s project and began working with the students to design and build the hull.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity to partner with artisan boat builders was an experience I never expected to have as an engineering student,\u201d says aeronautics and astronautics major Ahrif McKee, who is serving alongside Farrell as HPS co-captain this year. \u201cI think that\u2019s what makes our team unique \u2014 everything we do tends to be unexpected, curious and challenging.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the nature of the competition, and it\u2019s what drives us,\u201d adds Farrell.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>Why build a human powered sub, anyway?<\/b>\n\nUW\u2019s HPS team consists of approximately 40 students, mostly from mechanical engineering and aeronautics and astronautics, though some come from backgrounds like electrical engineering, business and psychology.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of overlap between the physics of building a submarine and building an airplane,\u201d explains McKee. \u201cIt\u2019s all about fluid dynamics \u2014 the way an object moves through a fluid. We tend to think of fluids as liquids, but air is also a fluid so a lot of the same principles apply.\u201d\n\nBeyond the annual ISR summer competition, human powered subs don\u2019t really serve a purpose. No one uses them in industry, they aren\u2019t a practical mode of transportation, and they can be an expensive hobby. Yet for those eager for an engineering challenge, they\u2019re perfect.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn even years, competitions are held at an aquatic center in Gosport, England, and in odd years, they take place at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.navsea.navy.mil\/Home\/Warfare-Centers\/NSWC-Carderock\/\">Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division,<\/a> a U.S. Navy complex near Washington, D.C. The UW team uses the same hull for two years, modifying the controls and drive mechanics so it will perform well in both locations.\n\nThe different pools present unique challenges. \u201cCarderock\u2019s pool is one of the longest in the world \u2014 nearly 2,000 feet long and 22 feet deep \u2014 so we\u2019re able to focus on top speed in a straight line, while the Gosport pool is shorter and wider, so challenges there include a lot of turning, winding courses and obstacles,\u201d explains McKee.\n\nThe subs have either one or two pilots, who squeeze inside, laying on their stomachs, and use their hands to steer, feet to pedal, and a scuba regulator to breathe. The submarines aren\u2019t watertight, so pilots must be scuba-certified. In a two-pilot sub, like Knotty Dawg, one pilot faces forward while the other faces backward, their feet meeting in the middle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not for the claustrophobic,\u201d says Farrell.\n\nWhile top speed is the goal at competition, both Farrell and McKee agree that good engineering is what really matters. Most all subs break or require immediate on-site fixes and just reaching the finish line can be a major challenge; fewer than half the subs actually make it across.\n\n\u201cWithout solid design and construction, it doesn\u2019t really matter how fast your pilots are \u2013 they\u2019re not going to be able to perform well if they don\u2019t have a top-notch sub,\u201d says Farrell.\n\n<b>A lasting impression<\/b>\n\n\u201cWhen the UW team presented their sub at ISR this year, I think every judge\u2019s initial reaction was, \u2018Wow, what a beautiful boat!\u2019 That was certainly mine,\u201d says Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper. A retired naval officer and former NASA astronaut, Stefanyshyn-Piper served as commander of NSWC Carderock from 2011 to 2015. During that time, she began volunteering as a competition judge.\n\n\u201cWe were impressed not only by the UW team\u2019s design this year but also by the fact that they\u2019d collaborated with a boatbuilding school,\u201d she says. \u201cTechnical partnerships can present their own challenges, and the team demonstrated a willingness to dive in and make it worthwhile for everyone.\u201d\n\nStefanyshyn-Piper says that the U.S. Navy is eager to support competitions like ISR because they give engineering students an opportunity to put theory into practice.\n\nPlus, the more engineering students interested in naval architecture, aerospace and marine engineering, the better for industry, she adds.\n\n<b>Next steps<\/b>\n\nThis year, HPS will alter Knotty Dawg\u2019s mechanics and controls in preparation for taking it to England next summer. They will also start working on the design for a new hull, which will debut at competition in summer 2019. They haven\u2019t yet decided if they\u2019ll stick with wood or try a new material.\n\nBut that creativity and exploration is part of the fun.\n\n\u201cBeing on the team is about so much more than just going to competition,\u201d McKee explains. \u201cWe get to develop hands-on skills, like manufacturing and assembly, learn how to use all sorts of tools in Mechanical Engineering\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.me.washington.edu\/shops\">prototype shops,<\/a> and apply what we\u2019ve learned in our classes \u2014 things like CAD, finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics \u2014 to an actual physical project.\u201d\n\nAs for the design and construction of their next sub?\n\n\u201cEveryone will just have to follow us online to find out what we come up with,\u201d says McKee. \u201cOr better yet, join the team and take part in the process!\u201d\n\nKeep up with UWHPS at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.uwhpsub.com\/\">www.uwhpsub.com<\/a>."},{"title":"A pocket-size research revolution","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/a-pocket-size-research-revolution\/","tags":["faculty","giving","school-of-pharmacy","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"With a device that can model a real kidney, researchers at the UW School of Pharmacy are giving hope to people with kidney conditions \u2014 as well as astronauts who dream of exploring the farthest reaches of space.","content":"(UW Homepage, October 2017)\n\nImagine that you live in a house on the beach.\n\nDay to day, your view of the ocean never seems to change. But after 10 or 15 years, you look outside one morning and see the water lapping at your porch.\n\nFor many, that\u2019s what it\u2019s like to have kidney disease. \u201cIt slowly progresses over years, maybe even decades, but people often don\u2019t know it until something goes wrong \u2014 until the water is at their door,\u201d explains Catherine Yeung, research assistant professor at the University of Washington School of Pharmacy.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that while 15 percent of American adults have chronic kidney disease, most of them don\u2019t know it. Only when the disease is in its later stages \u2014 when it\u2019s often too late for reversal \u2014 do more severe symptoms cause people to seek help.\n\nAn inability to track the early stages of chronic kidney disease leaves researchers like Yeung at a loss to understand what early biological markers might look like. There\u2019s also much to learn about how kidney problems affect the body\u2019s ability to eliminate medications.\n\nAt the School of Pharmacy, an interdisciplinary team is undertaking revolutionary work that could change the future of precision medicine and kidney research \u2014 all with a device the size of a credit card.\n\n<b>A breakthrough in kidney research<\/b>\n\nIt\u2019s called kidney-on-a-chip. Inside its small frame are thousands of live kidney cells that can model the functions of a human kidney. For pharmacy researchers, this device has opened up countless possibilities, as kidneys play a major role in the body\u2019s ability to process medications.\n\n\u201cKidneys are part of the \u2018holy trinity\u2019 of drug clearance,\u201d says Edward Kelly, associate professor at the School of Pharmacy and lead investigator on the project. \u201cThe intestine is involved in absorption, the liver is involved in metabolism and the kidneys are involved in excretion,\u201d he says, meaning that they help the body clear medication via urine.\n\nPeople with failing kidneys might not be able to process medications as efficiently as those with healthy kidneys. On top of that, there\u2019s the possibility that certain medications could further compromise unhealthy kidneys. This is critical because \u2014 unlike the liver and other organs \u2014 the kidney lacks the ability to regenerate.\n\nThat\u2019s where the UW is focusing with kidney-on-a-chip.\n\nWorking alongside Kelly and Yeung is Jonathan Himmelfarb, M.D., the Joseph W. Eschbach, M.D., Endowed Chair in Kidney Research at the UW School of Medicine and the internationally renowned director of the Kidney Research Institute, a collaborative effort between UW Medicine and Northwest Kidney Centers.\n\n\u201cThis big advance allows us to study the kidney in a very native, natural environment.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Catherine Yeung, Research Assistant Professor, UW School of Pharmacy\n\nWith support from both the UW and Northwest Kidney Centers, team members brought their expertise together for the kidney-on-a-chip project. The team was also instrumental in the design of the chip: They worked with UW spin-out Nortis to create a device that allows researchers to run medications through the system.\n\nPreviously, researchers would put kidney cells on a plate, add medications and examine the interaction. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what happens in the body,\u201d says Yeung. \u201cIn the body, there\u2019s always blood flowing, and one of the things that we\u2019ve been able to address with kidney-on-a-chip is that we have flow.\u201d As a result, the chip functions as a kidney normally would. \u201cWe push media through the chip using a syringe, and it flows out,\u201d says Kelly. The fluid is then collected and tested.\n\nWith a closed system, drugs can flow through the chip without requiring gravity to keep the fluids in contact with the cells. This distinguishing factor helped the UW team be selected for special research that they\u2019ll conduct in a place where liquids don\u2019t follow the laws of gravity \u2014 but more on that later.\n\n<b>A faster, safer method for testing medications<\/b>\n\nBy giving researchers the ability to test multiple drugs at the same time, the chip may lead to a quicker and safer approval process for new medications. Because the harmful effects of medications would be detected with the chip, the need for human and animal test subjects would drop dramatically.\n\nThe UW team has already begun testing various drugs, including antibiotics that are less harmful to kidneys.\n\n\u201cIn one instance, we tested two antibiotics against each other,\u201d describes Wade Washington, a sophomore at the UW and a researcher in Kelly\u2019s lab. \u201cWith the chips, we could tell that at certain dosages, one drug was less nephrotoxic [damaging to the kidneys] than the other.\u201d\n\nWashington knows firsthand the impact this research could have. He was born with chronic kidney disease and underwent a successful transplant when he was 15.\n\n\u201cI took antibiotics after my transplant surgery,\u201d Washington says. \u201cFor people like me with kidney disease, antibiotics can be a double-edged sword. I see the chips as definitely a better way to test for nephrotoxicity in new drugs.\u201d\n\n<b>Kidney-on-a-chip heads to outer space<\/b>\n\nWhat if you could speed up the development of kidney disease? What if you could see the water creeping toward your front door inch by inch?\n\nIn 2018, the UW team will have the opportunity to find out. They\u2019re sending kidney-on-a-chip to the one place where time does speed up: outer space.\n\nThanks to federal grants from the National Institutes of Health and NASA\u2019s Center for the Advancement of Science in Space, kidney-on-a-chip will be sent to the one place where time does speed up: outer space.\n\nMicrogravity acts as an accelerant, so kidney problems that take decades to develop on Earth need only weeks or months on the International Space Station, where astronauts will study the chips over the course of a few weeks.\n\n\u201cUse of the kidney-on-a chip here on Earth has already taught us a lot about kidney function and kidney diseases,\u201d says Himmelfarb. \u201cThe opportunity to study how the loss of gravitational forces affects kidney cellular function has the potential to improve the health of people on Earth, as well as prevent medical complications that astronauts experience from weightlessness.\u201d\n\n\u201cKidneys synthesize the active form of vitamin D, which is necessary to maintain healthy bones, so we\u2019ll be asking if kidney cells still perform that function in microgravity.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Edward Kelly, Associate Professor, UW School of Pharmacy\n\nTeam member Kenneth Thummel, the Milo Gibaldi Endowed Chair in Pharmaceutics at the School of Pharmacy, has previous experience keeping astronauts healthy. With long-standing research interests in vitamin D metabolism and the regulation of mineral homeostasis, a key component of kidney function, Thummel was part of a special National Research Council committee that established guidelines for chemical exposure in spacecraft air and water.\n\nBone loss is also a major concern for astronauts, Kelly says. \u201cThat\u2019s why astronauts exercise and employ other means to counter this issue when they\u2019re in space. Kidneys synthesize the active form of vitamin D, which is necessary to maintain healthy bones, so we\u2019ll be asking if kidney cells still perform that function in microgravity.\u201d\n\nSending kidney-on-a-chip to the Space Station also stands to benefit another group of interstellar travelers: the first Mars colonists.\n\nThe current record for the most consecutive days in space is 438 \u2014 but in theory, Mars colonists would remain for decades. After studying chips on the Space Station, researchers might have a better idea of how to help the human body withstand the effects of spending so much time in a lower-gravity environment.\n\n\u201cSending cells to space like this has never been done before,\u201d says Yeung. \u201cThis is experimental in the truest sense of the word, which is incredibly exciting.\u201d\n\n<b>Real-life impact for people with kidney disease<\/b>\n\nAfter the chips return from space, the UW team plans to use their improved understanding of kidney mechanics to test whether kidney-on-a-chip can be used to cure diseases, in addition to treating and preventing them.\n\nInstead of giving patients experimental treatments that may or may not work, \u201cWe could see the effects in kidney-on-a-chip before we test them in humans,\u201d says Kelly.\n\nFor the researchers involved, kidney-on-a-chip might very well bring about changes in their lifetime, a rarity for big medical breakthroughs. This trailblazing science is made possible in large part by donors who support the Pharmaceutics Fund for Excellence, which invests in startup research projects like kidney-on-a-chip.\n\nA mission to improve the lives of people around the world \u2014 and the solar system \u2014 is shared across the UW as part of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/populationhealth\">Population Health Initiative<\/a>. By leveraging capabilities and opportunities on campus and beyond, researchers will have the tools to create healthier and more fulfilling lives for all.\n\n\u201cAs a pharmacist, I\u2019m very satisfied to be able to show people what we\u2019re doing and where their research dollars are going,\u201d says Yeung. \u201cWith kidney-on-a-chip, we have an actual chance to impact the lives of patients.\u201d"},{"title":"Creating communities that care","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/creating-communities-that-care\/","tags":["giving","graduate-student","school-of-social-work"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"In central and southeast Seattle, students from the UW School of Social Work are joining with community leaders to increase young people's chances of achieving success.","content":"(UW homepage, October 2017)\n\nStephan Blount stands before a group of Madrona Elementary sixth-graders eager to be set free after sitting in classrooms all day. On this particular afternoon, he\u2019s teaching these young students about the best and worst ways to communicate.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s try a game,\u201d Blount tells them, and the children\u2019s faces light up instantly. \u201cEveryone get in a circle. I\u2019m going to whisper something in the ear of one of you. I want you to whisper that to the next person. When it\u2019s gone around the circle, we\u2019ll check how close it is to what we started with.\u201d\n\nIt may seem simple \u2014 but through games like telephone, Blount, a second-year master\u2019s candidate at the University of Washington School of Social Work, is working to change outcomes for youth through the principles of a program developed at the UW. It\u2019s called Communities That Care (CTC), and its evidence-based content is now used around the world.\n\n<b>Changing futures, one student at a time<\/b>\n\nFor his social work practicum, Blount is helping implement Communities That Care principles through Communities in Action, a program where Seattle community-based organizations come together to increase protective factors and reduce risk factors to promote healthy child development.\n\nAlong with fellow UW master\u2019s candidates Kelley Pascoe and Eric Agyemang, Blount is teaching students from schools in southeast and central Seattle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working to deliver life skills training to middle schoolers,\u201d Blount explains. \u201cOur part began after a group of agencies came together to address things in their communities affecting their youth that they wanted to work through.\u201d\n\nCommunities in Action began in 2013, when more than 2,300 students in grades six, eight, 10 and 12 responded to a survey about the challenges in their daily lives. Like the data from Communities That Care, the results showed that the students faced bullying, fighting, drug use and depression.\n\nMargaret Spearmon, chief officer of community engagement and diversity at the School of Social Work, oversees Communities in Action with project manager Vaughnetta J. Barton. Their goal is to help communities use data about their youth to make informed decisions on how to meet kids\u2019 needs \u2014 and develop a plan of action to meet those needs. While the communities drive the plan, local organizations and schools put it in play.\n\n<b>Inspired by his mother<\/b>\n\nCommunities That Care is close to Blount\u2019s heart. He was born to a 16-year-old single mother in Anchorage, Alaska, and during his childhood they often relied on outside assistance to cope with the challenges of everyday life.\n\n\u201cMy mom was so young when she had me,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had a lot of help from human service agencies while I was growing up. It taught me the importance of that type of work, and it gave me a lot of empathy for others facing similar challenges.\u201d\n\nIt also gave him a direction in life: social work. To support himself while earning an undergraduate degree in human services at the University of Alaska, Blount took a job working in a group home for adults with developmental disabilities.\n\n\u201cIt was just such cool work,\u201d he says. \u201cOne resident at the group home was around my age. I could see how he became more independent when you gave him opportunities to do so.\u201d\n\n<b>Healthy behaviors and bright futures<\/b>\n\nFostering healthy, resilient communities is part of the UW\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/populationhealth\/\">Population Health Initiative<\/a>, as well as a critical component of Communities That Care. In particular, a key tenet of the CTC program is that change must develop organically with the help of community stakeholders, rather than be imposed on them by an outside agency that thinks it knows best what a given group needs or wants.\n\nBecause the CTC program is evidence-based and draws on the strengths of the community it serves, Blount says he\u2019s confident the program will change the outcomes of the sixth-graders he works with.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just implementing what the stakeholders have chosen,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re the experts on what they need.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the model works. In the years since CTC was first implemented, numerous scientific studies have shown just how effective it is. Data from one CTC model shows that youth who participated in the program were 25 to 37 percent less likely to have health and behavior problems like smoking, drug and alcohol use, or delinquency.\n\nIn addition to improving lives, the program also offers significant cost savings: For every dollar invested in CTC, $5.31 is returned in the form of lower substance abuse and delinquency costs.\n\nAlongside the valuable partnerships with community members, a big part of the success of CTC and Communities in Action has been student support from the Excellence in Social Impact Scholarship. Blount, Agyemang and Pascoe all received scholarships from this fund, which was established in 2016 to help reduce the debt load of social work students. The fund is transforming the School of Social Work\u2019s ability to prepare highly gifted students to lead, innovate and serve in local, national and global communities.\n\nFor Blount, this financial support meant that he could focus time and energy on his studies and his students at Madrona Elementary. Even more important, it has helped him explore the career he knows he was meant to pursue. \u201cI have always been set on doing some sort of human services or social work,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself doing anything else.\u201d"},{"title":"A healthy future after kidney failure","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/a-healthy-future-after-kidney-failure\/","tags":["arts-sciences","school-of-pharmacy","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Following a successful kidney transplant, Wade Washington resolved to become a transplant surgeon himself. Now he's pursuing that dream at the UW.","content":"(UW homepage, October 2017)\n\nWade Washington was just 15 years old when he got a phone call that changed his life: He was going to receive a kidney transplant.\n\nAt birth, Washington was diagnosed with bilateral cystic kidney disease, a genetic disorder that caused one kidney not to function properly and prevented the other one from growing. For the first decade or so of his life, he could feel the symptoms of the disease, but they were mostly manageable.\n\n\u201cWhen I was younger, I wasn\u2019t in as critical of a state as when I began dialysis,\u201d says Washington. Despite facing symptoms like extreme fatigue and gout, he played football (wearing special kidney-protecting padding) and performed with the Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestra as a cellist. \u201cBut as I got into high school,\u201d he says, \u201cthat\u2019s when I really felt the effects of kidney disease.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s doctor told him that his kidneys were at only 11 percent functionality. Less than 25 percent means serious problems, and below 15 percent is considered kidney failure.\n\nWashington began dialysis not long after, and gradually he began spending more and more time at each dialysis treatment. About a year into treatment, he lost consciousness during one of his appointments. \u201cI was told that I would need to get a fistula, which is a permanent access point for dialysis,\u201d he says. This put him on the transplant list, where some patients stay for years as they wait to receive a new kidney.\n\n<b>The call that changed everything<\/b>\n\nA few months later, Washington\u2019s family received a call from Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital notifying them that he was second in line for a kidney. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a guarantee, but it was something,\u201d he says. \u201cThen the next morning, I got the phone call that I was now the primary recipient.\u201d It turned out the person ahead of him hadn\u2019t been a match.\n\n\u201cI was so excited, but at the same time, I had this realization that this other person wouldn\u2019t be getting a kidney today,\u201d Washington says. \u201cI realized that it\u2019s not just me in my bubble, and it wasn\u2019t really fair that I got the kidney and they didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWashington resolved to pursue a career where he could change that outcome. His decision was further solidified after he met Andre Dick, M.D., the surgeon who performed his kidney transplant.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw him, I was taken aback,\u201d says Washington. \u201cI always had a stereotypical view of a surgeon being an older white man, but when I saw that Dr. Dick was African American, I thought, \u2018I want to be him someday.\u2019\u201d\n\n<b>Helping others overcome kidney disease<\/b>\n\nNow a sophomore at the UW, Washington is thriving \u2014 and he\u2019s getting closer to his goal of becoming a transplant surgeon.\n\nThe summer before his freshman year, Washington took part in the <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/genomics\/index.shtml\">GenOM Project<\/a>, which pairs incoming freshmen from underrepresented communities with a lab on campus. As a result of his medical history and career goals, Washington was paired with Associate Professor Edward Kelly\u2019s lab at the School of Pharmacy. He liked the work so much that he\u2019s still a researcher on the team today, working with a device called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/boundless\/kidney-health\">kidney-on-a-chip<\/a>.\n\nKidney-on-a-chip houses live kidney cells that can model the functions of a real human kidney, creating a unique opportunity for kidney disease research. In collaboration with investigators at the UW Kidney Research Institute and with support from Northwest Kidney Centers, Kelly\u2019s lab is working alongside researchers from the School of Pharmacy and UW Medicine. The project was also funded by federal grants from the National Institutes of Health and NASA\u2019s Center for the Advancement of Science in Space.*\n\nIn his role on the team, Washington uses the chip to test the effects of various medications on kidneys to determine which ones are safest.\n\nThe work strikes a personal chord. \u201cI take drugs to keep my kidney going, and I took them a lot before my transplant,\u201d Washington says. For people with chronic kidney disease, antibiotics are a double-edged sword: While they help combat infection after operations, some can actually damage the kidneys.\n\n\u201cIt was my first step toward seeing the interdisciplinary nature of medicine,\u201d he says of the research. \u201cThe whole idea of a drug being toxic to kidneys wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d really thought about before. I felt like it would make me a much better physician to have this knowledge.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Washington completed the Summer Health Professions Education Program for students of color pursuing careers in medicine. For six weeks, he took classes at the UW Medical Center, networked with physicians and explored the different places where a career in medicine could lead.\n\nDespite the tough coursework and extracurricular pursuits of a pre-med student, it\u2019s clear that nothing can hold Washington back from becoming a surgeon. And the fact that he\u2019s overcome so much \u2014 that his own kidney transplant made it possible for him to reach this point \u2014 makes him even more thankful to be on that path.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been really fortunate to not have any rough spots since my transplant, and I\u2019m very grateful that I\u2019ve made it here,\u201d Washington says. \u201cI\u2019ve learned how to deal constructively with everything that I\u2019ve gone through, and I\u2019ve gained so much along the way.\u201d"},{"title":"A commitment to community","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/a-commitment-to-community\/","tags":["giving","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good","student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Thanks to our Be Boundless campaign sponsors, the UW is strengthening its efforts to serve others and create opportunities across the state.","content":"(UW homepage, October 2017)\n\nLast October, the University of Washington launched our most ambitious philanthropic campaign to date: Be Boundless \u2014 For Washington, For the World.\n\nIn the year since, support\u00a0from our campaign launch sponsors, including Boeing, Microsoft, Starbucks, the Seattle Times, AT&amp;T, Banner Bank and BECU, has enabled\u00a0the UW\u00a0to deepen our service to Washington communities, create opportunities and change futures through programs in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/omad\/\">Office of Minority Affairs &amp; Diversity<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/uaa\/\">Undergraduate Academic Affairs<\/a>.\n\n<b>Alternative Spring Break<\/b>\n\nEvery spring break since 2001, dozens of UW students have volunteered through\u00a0the UW Pipeline Project\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/expd.uw.edu\/pipeline\/alternative-spring-break\/\">Alternative Spring Break<\/a> program, which connects Huskies with educational and service opportunities in rural and tribal communities across the state.\n\nDuring Alternative Spring Break in 2017, UW student costs were covered, programs were expanded and \u2014 for the first time in the program\u2019s history \u2014 each of the 14 locations was able to host on-site community celebrations to wrap up the week.\n\n\u201cThe community celebration is so important,\u201d says Meaghan Ferrick, the program\u2019s Neah Bay project facilitator, who\u2019s working toward her Ph.D. at the\u00a0UW College of Education. \u201cThis is where relationships form.\u201d\n\nThrough the lens of a film project, six UW student volunteers guided Neah Bay fifth-graders on an exploration of potential careers. At the end of spring break, the community got a behind-the-scenes look at the kids\u2019 hard work over a shared dinner. This celebration gave students and their families the opportunity to spend time with the UW mentors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really nice to be able to get to know the people of Neah Bay and show our appreciation to the school and the community for letting us be here,\u201d says Ferrick.\n\nFor Neuee Vitalis, whose daughter went through the program, the gratitude goes both ways. \u201cAs a parent, I really appreciate the UW students\u2019 coming out and spending their spring break investing in my community and my kids.\u201d\n\n<i>Learn more about Alternative Spring Break service-learning experiences in\u00a0<\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/boundless\/alternative-spring-break-neah-bay\/\"><i>Neah Bay in 2017<\/i><\/a><i>, and\u00a0<\/i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/boundless\/alternative-spring-break\/\"><i>Omak and Brewster in 2016<\/i><\/a><i>.<\/i>\n\n<b>The Dream Project<\/b>\n\nThe college application process can be daunting: SAT prep, essays, financial aid. But imagine how much more daunting it would be if you were the first in your family to go to college. Who would you look to for help?\n\nFor some students in Federal Way, UW senior Nicole Collopy is one of those people. Collopy is an intern at Todd Beamer High School, where she recently started her second year as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/dreamproject\/\">UW Dream Project<\/a> College &amp; Career Readiness Assistant (CCRA). \u201cMy students are amazingly funny and bright,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has been the highlight of my college career.\u201d\n\nThe Dream Project \u2014 a program that helps low-income and first-generation students develop their post-high-school plans \u2014\u00a0places CCRAs as paid interns in local schools. The CCRAs work under school counselors to mentor students and lead workshops about pursuing higher education and accessing careers.\n\n\u201cHaving recently navigated this complex process themselves, interns are able to encourage and relate to the students they work with in a different way than professional adults,\u201d says Jessica Hunnicutt Batten, director of the Dream Project. \u201cThey also gain experience working in the K-12 system and deepen their critical thinking about college access, mentorship and social justice.\u201d\n\nIn 2016-17, the CCRA program received crucial support from campaign launch sponsors that funded 40 interns for an additional six months of in-school service.\n\n\u201cThe most rewarding aspect of the CCRA program is seeing how passionate these interns are about working with and supporting youth,\u201d says Hunnicutt Batten. \u201cThey are truly invested in the communities they serve.\u201d\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?time_continue=2&amp;v=tViVIkxZQOI\"><i>Watch a video<\/i><\/a><i>\u00a0about how the Dream Project helped turn Aisha Ali\u2019s dreams of college into reality.<\/i>\n\n<b>Math Science Upward Bound<\/b>\n\nFor six weeks each summer, a cohort of students from Seattle\u2019s Chief Sealth International, Cleveland and Franklin high schools floods the UW for the Office of Minority Affairs &amp; Diversity\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/uwmsub.org\/\">Math Science Upward Bound<\/a> program. They are eager to soak up everything they possibly can about science, technology, engineering and math. All the participants are either low-income or first-generation, and 85 percent are both.\n\n\u201cThe amount of exposure these students have to STEM labs, activities, technology, computers and advanced classwork is limited in their high schools,\u201d says the program\u2019s director, David Wolczyk. So it\u2019s especially valuable for them to get a crash course at the UW.\n\nDuring their time on campus, the students interact with dozens of faculty who lead various STEM seminars, and they have the opportunity to gain applicable skills for college and beyond. Thanks to additional support from campaign launch sponsors, students were able to visit the Boeing plant in Everett, meet with engineers and tour the 747, 777 and 787 production lines.\n\n\u201cThis funding transformed our program from one that <i>talks<\/i> about STEM to one that has our students actually <i>doing<\/i> STEM,\u201d says Wolczyk. \u201cThey really get to see what it\u2019s going to be like in these careers.\u201d\n\nFor students, the experience is life-altering. \u201cImagine going somewhere every day and being bombarded with knowledge you never had before,\u201d says Souleyman, a junior at Cleveland High. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything more productive to do than this in the summer. I learned how to code, I learned how to 3D print, I learned about physics. If you\u2019re hungry for knowledge, this is where you need to be.\u201d\n\n<b>Multicultural Outreach &amp; Recruitment<\/b>\n\nFor Cristina Gaeta, college can\u2019t be approached as one-size-fits-all. As director of <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/reach\/\">Multicultural Outreach &amp; Recruitment<\/a> (MOR) in the Office of Minority Affairs &amp; Diversity, she leads the effort to offer college access events that address the needs of low-income, first-generation and historically underrepresented students.\n\nOver the past year, campaign support enabled more than 1,000 students to get involved in MOR programming \u2014 including Shades of Purple, a two-day conference for underrepresented minority rising seniors in high school who are interested in attending the UW.\n\n\u201cCollege access events like these are important because we\u00a0meet prospective students and their families where they\u2019re at in their\u00a0understanding of\u00a0the pathway to college,\u201d says Gaeta. One such student was Kaya Warrior,\u00a0who visited\u00a0representing\u00a0Washington\u2019s Lummi Nation\u00a0when she was in high school.\n\nAfter Warrior participated in Shades of Purple, she knew the UW was the place for her. Now she\u2019s a senior and a MOR student ambassador, working with underrepresented prospective students to help them envision themselves at the UW and build a plan for their educational future. \u201cThis program gives students who weren\u2019t college-bound beforehand the inspiration and tools they need to be knowledgeable about the application process,\u201d she says.\n\nDuring Shades of Purple, prospective students learn about life at the University \u2014 as well as how to apply \u2014 from UW mentors and role models who cheer them on every step of the way. \u201cTo work with students through the entire process of essays and applications, then see them get admitted and bring their families with them to our spring conferences, makes it all worth it,\u201d says Warrior.\n\n<b>Undergraduate Community-Based Internships<\/b>\n\nPaid internships are rare \u2014 and paid public-service internships are even rarer. With funding from campaign launch sponsors, the\u00a02016-17 Carlson Center\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/carlson\/students-3\/public-service-fellowships-and-awards\/ucbi\/\">Undergraduate Community-Based Internships<\/a>\u00a0supported six new student internships with community-based organizations, totaling more than 1,200 hours of professional experience for students and service work for local partners.\n\n\u201cThis program extends access to internship opportunities in the nonprofit and public sectors to students who are unable to take on an unpaid internship,\u201d says director Rachel Vaughn. \u201cEducational stipends allow students of all income levels to access these high-impact experiences, gain professional skills and receive support from trained graduate and community mentors.\u201d\n\nGrace Novacek, a senior majoring in biology, received support for one such internship. She took on the role of investments and partnerships officer at the Prison Scholar Fund, which opens access to higher education, support and mentorship opportunities to incarcerated individuals and helps them integrate back into society.\n\nThe hands-on position was a perfect fit: Novacek could make an immediate impact while getting applicable professional experience \u2014\u00a0in her future career, she hopes to combat racial inequality in the criminal justice system. \u201cHearing the students\u2019 gratitude for what I see as the bare minimum we can do for those who are incarcerated is both humbling and rewarding,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had such a strong support system, both in the Prison Scholar Fund and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/carlson\/\">Carlson Center<\/a>, that\u2019s so willing to help me,\u201d says Novacek.\u00a0 \u201cThe Undergraduate Community-Based Internships experience is invaluable.\u201d\n\n<b>Upward Bound<\/b>\n\nThis past summer, 17 graduates from Seattle\u2019s Cleveland, Franklin and Chief Sealth International high schools chose to cut their summer short: They started college early.\n\nEnrolled in Early Fall Start, these students came to the UW in August for a four-week English course that gave them college writing credits \u2014 and much more.\n\n\u201cI learned about my study habits, how easy it is to make friends in class and how to reduce the chance of getting lost on campus,\u201d says Loleena Tang, who graduated from Franklin High this year. \u201cI feel so much more confident to start my freshman year. Early Fall Start helped me understand the UW on a deeper level.\u201d\n\nEarly Fall Start is just one aspect of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/omad\/upward-bound\/\">Upward Bound<\/a> program, housed in the Office of Minority Affairs &amp; Diversity, which helps economically disadvantaged and first-generation students prepare for college through tutoring, scholarship applications, career exploration and more. Students like Tang, who began participating in Upward Bound\u2019s intensive preparatory services when she was a sophomore, have benefited tremendously from the program.\n\nThis year, thanks to campaign launch sponsors, Upward Bound\u00a0offered the student cohort a special support class that eased the transition to college.\u00a0It helped them build community, learn college navigation skills and connect with on-campus resources.\n\n\u201cThis careful handoff from one support program to the next is vital for student success,\u201d says Roseann London, Upward Bound\u2019s interim director. \u201cAn investment in Upward Bound and Early Fall Start is an investment in the future success of these dedicated students. We can\u2019t wait to see what they do next in college \u2014 and ultimately in their careers.\u201d\n\n<b>Thank you to our campaign launch sponsors<\/b>\n\nThe UW is grateful for the boundless support of our campaign launch sponsors.

As a girl growing up in inner-city Los Angeles, she faced hardships that interfered with her education. \u201cI always loved school,\u201d Ingram said, \u201cbut there were other things in my life keeping me from being focused on school.\u201d\n\nIngram described her family\u2019s poverty and her mother\u2019s struggles. \u201cMy mother became disabled when I was 13 years old. At that age, I didn\u2019t understand it. It gave me a lot of anxiety. I couldn\u2019t concentrate, couldn\u2019t read my books. I think it affected me developmentally. I was insecure. I made mistakes.\u201d\n\nShe dropped out of high school and got married. She started a family. But the idea of getting an education never left her. Ingram completed her GED and then a high school diploma at Olympic College. She began taking classes toward an associate degree, slowly over many years, as she raised four children and worked to support them. \u201cI kept building my confidence,\u201d Ingram said. \u201cI kept saying to myself, \u2018You can do this.\u2019\u201d\n<h3>GOING FOR IT<\/h3>\nAs she earned her AA degree, Ingram started on a career path with a focus on helping others. Eventually, she became a case manager in a chemical dependency recovery center. But in time, the requirements of her job changed and she needed to have a bachelor\u2019s degree \u2014 something she always wanted to accomplish anyway, she said.\n\nWhen Ingram went online to research her options, she discovered the newly launched\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.earlychildhoodonline.uw.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bachelor of Arts in Early Childhood &amp; Family Studies<\/a>, a UW degree completion program developed and administered in partnership with Continuum College.\n\n\u201cOh my gosh, it was just like a miracle,\u201d Ingram said. \u201cBut then, did I think I\u2019d ever be accepted into that program? No way. The UW? With my rocky road to education?\u201d\n\nBut Ingram\u2019s children encouraged her to apply, and sure enough, she was admitted.\n<h3>SHOWING OTHERS WHAT'S POSSIBLE<\/h3>\nIngram was thrilled to have an opportunity to complete her degree at the UW. Even so, she still faced challenges \u2014 a demanding full-time job and children who needed her care.\n\nThen, during her last quarter in the program, she was hit with an almost overwhelming blow: Her landlord demanded that she move her family immediately so the house could be sold. She didn\u2019t see how she could keep up with the demands of work, life, moving and meeting her academic deadlines.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the kind of person that keeps things to myself, especially during a crisis,\u201d Ingram said. \u201cI know that\u2019s not a good thing, but that\u2019s how I grew up.\u201d\n\nBut finishing her degree was too important. She reached out for help to her academic adviser, Jenni Campbell, who contacted Ingram\u2019s professors. Together, they gave Ingram the support she needed to complete her credits and walk across the stage at graduation.\n\n\u201cI know that a good education can turn your life around,\u201d Ingram said. \u201cI wanted to be that inspiration for my children. And I\u2019m so happy I can be in a position to help mothers going though similar situations.\u201d"},{"title":"Reducing trash through thoughtful design","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/reducing-trash-through-thoughtful-design\/","tags":["arts-sciences","faculty"],"pillars":["innovation"],"image":"","excerpt":"An interactive recycling and composting station designed by a UW team will move to the HUB this summer.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, July 2017)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A UW student strolls past a trio of shiny bins for trash, recycling, and compost.\u00a0 She pauses, intrigued by colorful images cascading down vertical screens above each bin. As photos of coffee cups and banana peels and condiment containers scroll past, she tosses her own empty cuppa joe into the compost bin.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou just composted 2.31 ounces,\u201d announces a message on the compost screen. \u201cIf everyone on campus composted this amount today, UW would save $1,181.00.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The interactive recycling and composting station was designed by an interdisciplinary research group led by Karen Cheng and Kristine Matthews, professors of visual communication design in the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/art.washington.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">School of Art + Art History + Design<\/span><\/a>. The station was installed in UW\u2019s PACCAR Hall in 2016 and later relocated to Odegaard Library. It will move to its permanent home by the new Starbucks caf\u00e9\u00a0in the Husky Union Building (HUB) this summer, thanks to a collaboration with UW Housing and Food Services, UW Recycling, and the HUB.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The goal is to\u00a0divert\u00a0garbage from landfills.\u00a0\u201cThe bins give users positive feedback for recycling or composting their waste,\u201d says Cheng. \u201cThis was very surprising to users, because the normal trash experience is mindless\u2014people generally don\u2019t think at all when throwing something away.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The station consists of three bins, each fitted with a weight sensor, microcomputer, and digital screen. Scrolling images remind users which items go into each receptacle. When people toss items into the compost or recycling bins, a sensor weighs the deposit and the screen switches to a message about how much money was saved by that action, as well as the hypothetical savings if everyone on campus did the same.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The interactive station was inspired by a course in the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/mhcid.washington.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Master of Human Computer Interaction and Design<\/span><\/a>\u00a0(MHCI+D) program, co-taught by Cheng and MHCI+D director Linda Wagner. After hearing from guest speakers from\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/facilities.uw.edu\/bsd\"><span class=\"s2\">UW Recycling<\/span><\/a>\u00a0and the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/uwgarbology.weebly.com\/\"><span class=\"s2\">UW Garbology Project<\/span><\/a>, students had three weeks to come up with design solutions for reducing waste on campus. Two ideas seemed feasible\u2014one showed the money saved through recycling and composting, the other used a steady stream of images to explain what goes in each bin. Cheng decided to combine the two ideas, eventually receiving support from the UW\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/research\/or\/royalty-research-fund-rrf\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Royalty Research Fund<\/span><\/a>\u00a0to realize the project. By the time the funding arrived, the MHCI+D students had graduated and moved on, so Cheng recruited Matthews and a group of design students to help with the project.\u00a0The first task was to learn what aspects of recycling and composting trip people up the most. By testing the sorting skills of UW staff and students, the team learned that the biggest challenge is knowing what is compostable. (For the record, almost everything purchased in a UW dining hall or cafe is compostable, including straws and stir sticks. Chip bags and granola bar\u00a0wrappers are among the rare exceptions.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The team designed simple yet engaging scrolling displays to remind users what goes in each bin, and developed messages about cost savings, which pop up when items are tossed in the recycle or compost bins. The team considered adding a \u201cka-ching\u201d with each deposit, but decided the sound might be too repetitive and distracting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After the interactive station was installed, Cheng and Matthews collaborated with anthropology professor Peter Lape and doctoral candidate Jack Johnson to study its impact. \u201cIn the beginning, many people watched the display without using it,\u201d Cheng recalls. \u201cAfter about a week they started using it, and showing how it worked to others. That\u2019s one of the fascinating things about interaction design\u2014seeing how people actually use a product, and seeing it change behavior.\u201d The team found that correct composting increased by 20 percent and incorrect recycling decreased by 15 percent at the new station. The overall amount of waste correctly diverted from landfill increased by 8 percent\u2014a substantial environmental impact. The project has since been recognized by design and sustainability groups, earning awards from\u00a0<i>Communication Arts<\/i>\u00a0and the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/segd.org\/smart-bins\"><span class=\"s2\">Society of Experiential Graphic Design<\/span><\/a>, and being named a Kimberly-Clark Sustainable Campus Competition finalist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The interactive station will get more of a workout in the HUB, which is visited by thousands of people each day. The team is adding an animated clip of corn morphing into a plastic cup to stress that the UW\u2019s plastic cups are compostable, and they may tweak other aspects of the display to encourage more composting and recycling. Cheng is also working with the UW startup\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/evoeco.com\/\"><span class=\"s2\">EvoEco<\/span><\/a>\u00a0to commercialize the design for broader use in the private sector and at other universities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to get people to change behavior,\u201d says Cheng. \u201cBut we\u2019re hoping that we can make recycling and composting fun and interesting by giving people positive feedback for doing the right thing.\u201d<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Women's Center leads anti-human trafficking efforts","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/womens-center-leads-anti-human-trafficking-efforts\/","tags":["arts-sciences","faculty","giving"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"A Women's Center report addresses human trafficking in Washington state.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, July 2017)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For many people, the term \u201chuman trafficking\u201d conjures images of young girls forced into sex labor in distant lands. But human trafficking \u2014 the act of obtaining a person through force, fraud, or coercion for economic gain \u2014 is also found in industries from agriculture to domestic work to hospitality. And it\u2019s not just a problem abroad. Human trafficking is a growing issue in the Northwest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cHuman trafficking is one of the fastest growing underground economies in the world,\u201d says Sutapa Basu, director of the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/womenctr\/#sthash.qoUIPPvK.dpbs\"><span class=\"s2\">UW Women\u2019s Center<\/span><\/a>, who has studied the issue for more than two decades. \u201cIt is a $150 billion industry affecting millions of people around the globe. Two-thirds of human trafficking is in forms of labor other than sex trafficking.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Basu and Johnna White, program manager at the Women\u2019s Center, recently completed a state-funded study that provides recommendations for addressing human trafficking in Washington state. The\u00a0<span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/womenctr\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/Human-Trafficking-Supply-Chains-Report-2017.pdf\">115-page report<\/a>\u00a0<\/span>includes statistics but also stories of those victimized by human trafficking, such as Thai workers duped by a recruiter promising agricultural jobs in Washington. When the Thai workers arrived in the U.S., many having spent their life savings to pay the recruiter, their new employer confiscated their passports and forbade them to leave the premises, forcing them to work for little or no pay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Basu has heard such stories for years. Her early research focused on sex trafficking in India, but she became aware of other forms of human trafficking long before most officials recognized there was a problem. In the early 2000s, Basu joined with former state representative Velma Veloria and victim\/survivor advocate Emma Catague to approach the Washington State Legislature about human trafficking, but most officials were unconvinced that trafficking was happening domestically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cAt the time, they said, \u2018That\u2019s not a problem we have here. That\u2019s something that happens abroad,\u2019\u201d Basu recalls. \u201cNow they all acknowledge the problem here.\u201d In fact, with guidance from Basu, Veloria, and Catague, Washington became the first state to criminalize human trafficking. Yet even now, most anti-human trafficking laws are geared to sex trafficking. The next step, Basu says, is to focus on other forms of trafficking.Washington is particularly susceptible to human trafficking due to its international border, seaport, and large agricultural industry. The need for agricultural workers, who often work in isolated environments and face language barriers, makes that industry especially vulnerable. But the problem touches other Washington industries as well, including companies that employ factory workers halfway around the world.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cGlobalization has significantly changed the scene from the\u00a01990s\u00a0to today and made this issue so much bigger,\u201d says White. \u201cThe underbelly of globalization, the desire to create the cheapest goods, has created more sweatshops and more human trafficking situations. And it means that all of the goods we consume are more likely to have been touched by trafficked labor. The supply chains have gotten so much more complex, with layers and layers of contractors.\u201d Even within Washington\u2019s local supply chains, human trafficking has been reported in 18 counties within numerous industries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Companies sometimes dodge human rights concerns by hiring locals to oversee factories in other countries, washing their hands of the issue. The Women\u2019s Center report recommends that companies be responsible for their supply chain all the way to the bottom, using independent third-party monitoring to ensure that factories are compliant.

Some companies conduct in-house monitoring of their own supply chain and insist that is sufficient. Basu and White believe that monitoring by a neutral third party is important, but they tread lightly in the report. \u201cCorporations don\u2019t want to be legislated,\u201d admits Basu, \u201cso one of the things we\u2019ve done in the report is to focus on the public sector, including state universities and state procurement policies.

And some, including a handful of UW CEE researchers, actually work on them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Light rail will cross a floating bridge for the first time in the world when construction is completed on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.soundtransit.org\/eastlink\"><span class=\"s2\">Sound Transit\u2019s East Link Extension Project<\/span><\/a>\u00a0in 2023. The engineering feat is possible thanks to the work of UW CEE researchers, led by professor\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ce.washington.edu\/people\/faculty\/stantonj\"><span class=\"s2\">John Stanton<\/span><\/a>, who have collaborated with Sound Transit officials and Parsons Brinckerhoff consultants for the past five years. The UW CEE researchers have been primarily involved in testing various prototypes, which have never before been implemented. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo one has ever put light rail on a floating bridge, so there is no precedent,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just pull a design off the shelf and say \u2018Let\u2019s do this the same as before.\u2019 At every turn you have to be ready for something coming at you from left field.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Construction kicked off on the project in June 2017. The project entails replacing two lanes down the middle of the Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge, commonly known as I-90, with dual-track light rail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">UW CEE researchers are currently testing a prototype to resolve a final engineering challenge. As their work starts to wind down, their fingerprints can be seen on various aspects of the project, which will enable an engineering challenge to become a reality. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The first challenge: Constantly changing lake levels<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The CESuRa system is designed to enable light rail to smoothly cross areas between fixed and floating portions of the bridge. Credit: Sound Transit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The history of the light rail addition dates back to 1976, when a pact was signed to add high-capacity transit to the I-90 bridge. It wasn\u2019t until 2010, however, that Sound Transit officials were ready to start working on the feasibility of the project and hired consultants with Parsons Brinckerhoff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The primary challenge was figuring out how to address the constantly changing levels of the lake and other movements that affect the bridge. Depending on the season, the water level of Lake Washington fluctuates up to three feet from winter to summer. The floating bridge is also vulnerable to other forces, such as wind, waves and vehicle weight. This constant movement becomes problematic where the floating sections meet the fixed sections of the bridge, which are joined by hinge-like transition spans. When the water is low, the steepness of the transition span increases. While this isn\u2019t a problem for vehicles, it is an issue for inflexible light rail tracks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThis was the first problem they came up against, which is where we came in,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cThe rails would need to bend like a hinge at the transition spans. But rails, made of stiff, strong steel, don\u2019t bend like that. So you have a problem.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To enable light rail to smoothly cross the transition spans, an engineer from England, Andy Foan, developed a novel system called the Curved Element Supported Rail (CESuRa) track bridge system. The system responds to changes in the lake level and movement from all directions, including vertical, lateral and roll forces.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is achieved with curved track supports in two independent planes, which automatically adjust in response to bridge movements, ensuring the track remains smooth across the transition spans. The system borrows a critical concept from earthquake engineering: don\u2019t fight the forces. The curved track supports sit atop bearings that move several inches in all directions in response to various bridge movement, keeping the rail steady above.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt all comes down to this passively adjusting system. The way the system works is quite clever in that it supports the railroad ties on a curve,\u201d said UW CEE alumnus Travis Thonstad (Ph.D. \u201816), who worked on the project while earning his master\u2019s degree.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Prototype testing of the CESuRa system started in 2012, which Thonstad oversaw in the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ce.washington.edu\/research\/facilities\/structures\"><span class=\"s2\">Structural Research Laboratory<\/span><\/a>. A quarter of the system was tested at full-scale on a custom designed steel rig that simulates train motion with vertical weight and other forces, such as wind and waves, through horizontal motion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The testing uncovered a few initial problems, such as just how precisely the system needed to be fabricated and assembled in order for it to properly work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt works like a Swiss watch, so we had to work it out a piece at a time,\u201d Thonstad said. \u201cBut the challenges ended up paying off in the end, in terms of making sure the product was better.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Following the prototype testing, full-scale testing took place at the Transportation Technology Center in Pueblo, Colorado, in 2013. Thonstad worked alongside consultants with Parsons Brinckerhoff during the six-month testing process, which entailed testing two CESuRa systems at high speeds with various water levels on a customized 5,000 foot-long track. The testing confirmed that the system not only worked, but met safety standards and could operate at a speed of 55 mph, which was faster than engineers initially thought possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The second challenge: Attaching rails without bolts\u00a0<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A second technical challenge was looming, this time of a different nature. As part of Sound Transit\u2019s agreement to add light rail to the I-90 floating bridge, which is owned by the Washington State Department of Transportation, it was stipulated that no holes could be drilled into the existing bridge. This meant that connecting the light rail track to the bridge via traditional methods, such as bolts, was out of the question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cBecause it is a floating bridge, even a single hole in the bridge deck is not allowed,\u201d said CEE graduate research assistant Kristina Tsvetanova, who is testing the latest prototype that addresses the problem. \u201cEngineers had to come up with a completely new system.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sound Transit engineers dreamed up many schemes and settled on layering adhesives between the bridge deck and rails. While this may sound like a simple solution, it wasn\u2019t without challenges.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition to securing the rails to the bridge deck, the adhesives must also perform other functions. Without soil underneath the rails, the adhesives must adequately absorb track vibrations to ensure a smooth ride. The adhesives also must be flexible enough to not cause the concrete to crack due to shrinkage after the curing process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The first adhesive prototype was tested in 2014 by UW CEE alumnus Matthew Sisley (MSCE \u201915). After many rounds of testing, Sisley found that the adhesives were not flexible enough to absorb track vibrations. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe provided reports to Sound Transit that indicated they needed to move in another direction,\u201d Sisley said. \u201cThe consultants basically took our test results and used that to inform the next iteration of the design.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Now, three years later, a third design concept is being tested, which consists of a layer of epoxy grout above which a rubbery material, called Corkelast, rests. Compared to the first prototype, the latest model features a different concrete block design and a new type of metal fastener, or \u201crail clip.\u201d Tsvetanova is leading the team conducting the tests, which will evaluate whether the concrete blocks crack, if the layers separate, and if vibrations are adequately absorbed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This fall, the researchers will conduct additional tests on blocks that have been heated and cooled to simulate seasonal changes, which have the potential to induce further stresses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With construction of the light rail project already underway, the researchers are eager to finalize the designs\u2014 but not until they get it just right.<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Undaunted passion: Making STEM education accessible","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/undaunted-passion-making-stem-education-accessible\/","tags":["engineering","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"HCDE major Tsewone Melaku is aligning her interests in engineering with her passion to make STEM education accessible to underrepresented high school students.","content":"(College of Engineering, August 2017)\n\nTsewone Melaku discovered engineering in high school through a UW mentorship program. Now a UW student majoring in HCDE, she is aligning her interests in engineering with her passion to make STEM education accessible to underrepresented high school students.\n\nMelaku benefited from many of the same UW college access programs in which she now holds leadership roles, such as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/dreamproject\/\">Dream Project<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/womenctr\/making-connections\/\">Women\u2019s Center Making Connections<\/a> program. She shares with us why it\u2019s important to prioritize social justice issues and how she balances volunteering with her engineering studies.\n\n<b>What led you to the UW?<\/b>\n\nI attended high school here in Seattle, first at Ingraham and then at Chief Sealth. I struggled with math during my sophomore year to the point that I nearly failed. A friend was involved with Making Connections, a college readiness program offered through the UW Women\u2019s Center. The program prepares Seattle-area high school girls from low-income communities for success in STEM fields in college. It offers everything from one-on-one tutoring and mentoring to college tours, job shadowing opportunities and college application workshops.\n\nI got involved with Making Connections because I needed a tutor, but it opened my eyes to so much more! I\u2019m the first in my family to go to college; my parents are from Ethiopia, and the higher education system here was completely unfamiliar to us. After Making Connections, I sought out all the admissions support programs I could. I passed my math class and attended <a href=\"https:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/reach\/events-and-programs\/spring-events\/young-gifted-black\/\">Young, Gifted and Black<\/a>, a UW conference on social consciousness, cultural awareness and the importance of higher education for Black high school students. I signed up for the Dream Project, a program that partners UW students with first-generation and underrepresented high school students to assist in the college admissions process. I also joined UW\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/foster.uw.edu\/academics\/degree-programs\/undergraduate-programs\/diversity-services\/young-executives-of-color-yeoc\/\">Young Executives of Color<\/a> program, certain that I\u2019d major in business.\n\n<b>Why did you decide to study <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hcde.washington.edu\/\"><b>HCDE<\/b><\/a><b>?<\/b>\n\nI first learned about HCDE through a Making Connections networking event, where a panel of Seattle-area women engineers talked to us about their careers. One woman \u2014 an employee at Boeing \u2014 was an HCDE alumna. I\u2019d never heard of HCDE, but as she described it, I just kept thinking how cool it sounded. HCDE focuses on end users; it\u2019s a field of engineering that\u2019s all about helping people, and that really aligned with my personal interests.\n\nNot long after enrolling at the UW, I switched from being a pre-business major to majoring in HCDE. It\u2019s been a great fit. I love the way it\u2019s trained me to think creatively and solve problems.\n\n<b>Tell us more about how HCDE and your academic goals overlap with your interests in creating awareness, access and exposure to opportunities for underrepresented high school students.<\/b>\n\nI want to use my engineering background to help transform education, so I\u2019m also minoring in the UW\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/programs\/undergraduate\/els\">Education, Learning &amp; Society program<\/a>. My research interests involve the lack of diversity in higher education, particularly in STEM. I want to figure out ways to create better technology \u2014 and technical literacy \u2014 for underserved K-12 classrooms. There are huge gaps between technology, access and underrepresented communities. I hope to apply HCDE\u2019s approach to user-centered problem solving and design to create technologies that meet the needs of low-income and underserved students.\n\nI want to put my degree to work after graduating, but I also want to go to graduate school and study human-computer interaction. My ultimate goal is a Ph.D. in engineering education.\n\n<b>You continue to be involved with Making Connections and the Dream Project as an engineering student. Why?<\/b>\n\nMaking Connections is my second family, and I help anytime I can. I want kids to believe that higher education is an option, even if it seems impossible. I\u2019ve been there; I know how tough it can be when you\u2019re fifteen and asked to think about your college aspirations, yet the idea of going to college seems like something beyond your world. If I can share my experiences and skills in ways that help high schoolers see themselves as part of this world, then count me in. Especially for girls of color. If we want girls of color to pursue STEM, they need to see women of color being successful in STEM fields.\n\nI got involved with the Dream Project primarily to help transform it. I valued what the program was trying to do but from my high school experience, I saw ways it could be improved. I was invited to join the Dream Project\u2019s leadership team and teach UW students how to be mentors in high schools after serving as a mentor myself. We\u2019ve reshaped the course curriculum to include \u2014 and prioritize \u2014 topics like power, privilege, oppression, racism and social awareness. Many of the Dream Project\u2019s student mentors are white or come from privileged backgrounds, and most of the high school students they\u2019re mentoring aren\u2019t, and we felt that it was crucial to overhaul our training practices. We\u2019ve also updated the program\u2019s mission statement and introduced racial equity workshops for leaders and mentors.\n\n<b>You\u2019re also involved with the UW chapter of <\/b><a href=\"http:\/\/students.washington.edu\/uwnsbe\/index.html\"><b>National Society of Black Engineers<\/b><\/a><b> (NSBE) and <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.engr.washington.edu\/current\/studentprogs\/wise\"><b>Women in Science &amp; Engineering<\/b><\/a><b> (WiSE).

Last year, I served as UW NSBE\u2019s Pre-College Initiative (PCI) Chair and am now serving as the regional PCI Chair. In this role, I work with Black high school students who want to pursue engineering in college. This year we\u2019ll be starting two NSBE Jr. high school chapters in Seattle! In addition to helping them and the other UW chapter leaders, I\u2019ll also be planning the regional PCI conference for NSBE.\n\n<b>How do you balance your engineering studies with your commitments to UW access programs?<\/b>\n\nI\u2019m involved in a lot of campus activities, but they\u2019re activities that I\u2019m passionate about. I never feel like, \u201cOh great, I have to go do X.\u201d It\u2019s always more like, \u201cCool, I get to go do X.\u201d I try to make time for the things that make me happy. I\u2019m fortunate that engineering is one of those things. Helping people makes me happy, and through HCDE I\u2019m learning all sorts of new ways to help.\n\nI wanted to be an engineer to prove that I could do it and to show other Black girls that they could, too. Being an engineering student \u2014 as well as a mentor, teacher and advocate on campus \u2014 is a lot of work, but it\u2019s work that I care about and that I want to do.

Little did he know that his diary would became the inspiration for an international research project more than a century later, eventually leading to the creation of an independent publishing house founded by UW faculty.\n\nSvoboda wrote about Bedouins, political figures, and clergymen that he encountered as he traveled to Paris by way of Damascus, Cairo, and Brindisi in 1897. His observations, colored by his unique perspective as a European raised in Baghdad, provide valuable insights into the region at that time. The diary was passed down to subsequent generations of the Svoboda family, until the last Svoboda hired Iraqi researcher Nowf Allawi to transcribe the diary, handwritten in colloquial Arabic. Allawi ran into problems translating some Ottoman Turkish phrases in the text and reached out to Walter Andrews, research professor in the UW <a href=\"https:\/\/nelc.washington.edu\/\">Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilization<\/a> (NELC).\n\n\u201cShe was going to translate and publish the diary but didn\u2019t know how to do any of those things,\u201d recalls\u00a0 Andrews. \u201cI told her that publishing something this specific was not going to be tremendously interesting to a hard-copy publisher, but that we could help her get it published in a digital format.\u201d\n\nThat conversation led to a collaboration between Allawi and Andrews, who invited UW students to help with the project. The team digitized and enhanced the diary, adding interactive resources and visuals that include\u00a0a map of Svoboda\u2019s journey, background information on his family, and historical implications of the text. The enhanced journal is available <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/svobodad\/alexander.html\">online<\/a> and through print-on-demand.\n\nThat effort led to others, including digitizing dozens of diaries written by Alexander\u2019s father, Joseph Mathia Svoboda. As the project grew, nearly three dozen student interns volunteered each quarter. At the same time, Andrews reached out to colleagues interested in digitizing other unpublished texts of scholarly value and launched <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newbookdigitaltexts.org\/\">Newbook Digital Texts<\/a>, a publishing house for digital texts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making documents freely available that were inaccessible or in danger of being destroyed,\u201d says Sarah Ketchley, NELC lecturer and co-founder of Newbook Digital Texts. \u201cBy digitizing and coding the text in XML and making it machine readable, researchers are now able to mine the texts for data and look for common themes. That is the benefit of the digital humanities and an important skill for humanities graduate students to develop.\u201d\n\nKetchley\u2019s first Newbook project has been a series of detailed journals written by Emma B. Andrews, the mistress of millionaire lawyer Theodore M. Davis, an archaeologist and collector. The journals detail the couple\u2019s trips to Egypt between 1882 and 1912, including Davis\u2019s important but underreported excavations of 20 significant tombs in the Valley of the Kings.\n\n\u201cEmma paints a revealing picture of the lives of colonial gentry and the cultural and scientific literati in Egypt at the dawn of the twentieth century,\u201d says Ketchley. \u201cWith the digitization and analysis of her unpublished diaries, scholars and the public will have access to an important historical resource for the first time.\u201d\n\nNewbook\u2019s third co-founder, Mary Childs, is translating and digitizing Georgian literature to share online. \u201cIt started as a personal mission to present translations from Georgian, because when I was writing my dissertation there\u00a0was very little translated or readily available,\" says Childs, a lecturer in the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures and the Comparative History of Ideas program. \"I am now able to use the material in my courses, and share it with colleagues in Georgia.\"\u00a0Childs\u2019 Georgian Digital Text Collective offers selected works of Georgian literature, with the texts presented in Georgian and English side-by-side.\n\nAll of these projects are time intensive, involving transcription, text encoding, data visualization, web development, marketing, and more. Fortunately, students are eager to help. Since 2013, more than 130 interns from 33 UW departments have volunteered on\u00a0Newbook\u00a0projects, some of them for multiple years.\n\nKelsie\u00a0Haakenson\u00a0(2017) began working with the\u00a0Svoboda\u00a0Diaries team as a freshman, intrigued by the opportunity to conduct research in the humanities. \u201cWorking with the\u00a0Newbook\u00a0Digital Texts project became the backbone of my undergraduate experience,\u201d she says. \u201cReading Joseph\u00a0Svoboda\u2019s diary became a regular cadence to each week, as I stayed up until the wee hours each Tuesday to finish my assignment. My interest in primary sources grew steadily as I learned more detail of\u00a0Svoboda\u2019s life, thoughts, health, and everyday musings.\u201d\n\nHaakenson also dove into technical aspects of the project and discovered she liked those as well. Already a history major, she added a second major in computer science with the goal of becoming a digital historian. The Newbook team witnesses such transformations all the time. \u201cWe provide an interface between technology and the humanities,\u201d says Andrews, \u201cso our humanities students learn a lot of technology and our technology students learn about the humanities.\u201d\n\nThe team encourages interns to pursue their own research, and has sent students to national humanities conferences to present their work. Hannah Jolibois, a major in public health, developed a project based on Joseph Svoboda\u2019s final journals, when he was dying and taking numerous medications. She researched the medications, how they were used, and how many are still being used today. \u201cStudents have the opportunity to do historical research using primary materials that are largely unpublished,\u201d says Ketchley. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting for them.\u201d\n\nSoon students will have even more opportunities. The Newbook team recently launched its most ambitious project yet, focusing on the works of Baki, a renowned 16th\u00a0century Ottoman poet. The only existing edition of Baki\u2019s collected works is compiled from just a dozen of his nearly 200 manuscripts, so an international team is collecting other Baki manuscripts for this project, with support from the UW Royalty Research Fund.\n\nNewbook Digital Texts is hosted by NELC.\u00a0Funding has included a National Endowment for the Humanities startup grant, a UW Simpson Center for the Humanities grant, and multiple smaller stipends and awards. The Newbook team would like to secure additional funding so that more materials can be shared and more students can be introduced to the digital humanities \u2014 often a transformational experience.\n\n\u201cI had no idea just how invested and interested I would become in this project,\u201d says alumna Meg Ainsley (BA, NECL, 2012), who interned for the Svoboda Diaries Project and went on to pursue a master\u2019s degree in digital humanities. \u201cThe work\u2026has shaped both my current academic and professional interest.\u00a0 I can honestly claim that working [on this project] was one of the highlights and true accomplishments of my undergraduate career.\u201d\n\n<i>Find more about Newbook projects and view digitized documents at the <\/i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.newbookdigitaltexts.org\/\"><i>Newbook Digital Texts<\/i><\/a><i> website.To learn how you can support this work, contact Sharon Dana at <\/i><a href=\"mailto:sdana@uw,edu\"><i>sdana@uw.edu<\/i><\/a><i> or 206-543-6908.<\/i>"},{"title":"Building a better battery","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/building-a-better-battery\/","tags":["alumni","engineering","faculty"],"pillars":["innovation"],"image":"","excerpt":"Imagine revolutionizing the renewable energy market with the silica gel packets you find in shoeboxes and snack bags.

For example, if you want to watch T.V. after dark, you can\u2019t rely on direct solar power. So, to provide on-demand power, renewable energy is stored in batteries. To store a lot of energy, you need a lot of really big batteries \u2014 this is often referred to as \u201cgrid-scale\u201d storage. Flow batteries are the ideal choice for grid-scale energy storage, but they tend to be very pricy in large part due to their complex polymer membranes. This is where Membrion is changing things: We\u2019re making membranes from silica gel instead. It\u2019s more durable, less expensive, and will yield better performance overall. Our goal is to make batteries affordable and efficient so that renewable energy becomes an even more accessible and desired source to power communities worldwide.\n\n<b>What is a flow battery, and what is a battery membrane?<\/b>\n\nGN: Flow batteries are considered the best option for grid-scale energy storage due to their scalability, safety and adjustable energy and power rating. They work by pumping water-based electrolyte solutions into a cell. The electrolytes can be charged or discharged depending on whether a current is being applied from a solar cell or wind turbine, or if it is being extracted, like when it\u2019s delivered to homes. The flow battery\u2019s membrane must be able to filter molecules so that some pass through quickly while others do not. Only certain materials allow for this sort of filtering, and to date polymers have been the go-to.\n\n<b>How did you come up with the idea to use silica instead?<\/b>\n\nGN: There has been a lot of interest in finding reliable, less costly alternatives to the complex polymer membranes that are currently used. Many researchers are trying to make new membranes out of inexpensive plastics, but they just degrade slowly over time. Instead of creating a new kind of plastic, Professor Pozzo suggested that we try to repurpose pre-existing materials. After about a year of research, we hit on it: silica gel. It\u2019s a ceramic, so it\u2019s more chemically stable than many polymers, so it lasts longer. Additionally, its tunable pores allow it to filter molecules better. As soon as it made sense, we filed a provisional patent.\n\n<b>Why was it important to develop this technology with commercialization in mind from the start?<\/b>\n\nLP: We\u2019ve always had the real-world application of this work in mind, so we\u2019ve been advancing both research and commercialization simultaneously from the project\u2019s first days. For me, it has been a wonderful way to combine my research interests with my interests in supporting student-driven entrepreneurship. Though we\u2019re still refining the technology here at the UW, part of the team has spun out and is designing a product to enter the flow battery market. Greg is leading that technology translation, and he\u2019s been very successful so far.\n\nGN: The Pacific Northwest is the perfect place to be doing this work, as some of the country\u2019s leading battery manufacturing companies are here, such as UniEnergy Technologies in Mukilteo and Energy Storage Systems near Portland. The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) is here too. These companies and research labs have been very helpful and are eager to see this technology become successful.\n\n<b>How has the UW helped support you in entrepreneurship?<\/b>\n\nLP: The UW has developed a great ecosystem for supporting successful student entrepreneurship. The community has put a lot of thought into how to provide resources that complement each other and encourage growth and learning through coaching and funding.\n\nGN: We\u2019ve benefited from support from a number of units, and we are so grateful for all of them! The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cei.washington.edu\/\">Clean Energy Institute<\/a> (CEI) awarded us fellowship and travel grants, allowing us to attend research forums and business plan competitions across the country. We\u2019ve received funding from the Murdock Charitable Trust, <a href=\"http:\/\/comotion.uw.edu\/\">CoMotion<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/catalyst.amazon.com\/\">Amazon Catalyst<\/a> to help us bridge the gap from idea to product, hire research assistants and advance our work. CoMotion also provided valuable IP coaching and helped us apply for our patent.\n\nWe\u2019ve also participated \u2014 and placed \u2014 in some of the <a href=\"http:\/\/foster.uw.edu\/centers\/buerk-ctr-entrepreneurship\/\">Buerk Center for Entrepreneurship\u2019s<\/a> competitions, like the Environmental Innovation Challenges and Business Plan Competitions. But I\u2019d say that the Center\u2019s Jones + Foster Accelerator \u2014 a structured program that helps early-stage student companies through their initial months \u2014 has been most helpful in getting the business of Membrion off the ground.\n\n<b>What have you enjoyed most about developing Membrion?<\/b>\n\nGN: I get to combine the research and engineering skills I developed as a student with my interest in business development. In chemical engineering, we\u2019re working to solve long-term, complicated problems; adding a business layer makes them even more complex and, in my opinion, more fun. I get to draw from all of that as I train and mentor our student research assistants and communicate our product\u2019s significance to prospective partners and investors.\n\nLP: I\u2019ve enjoyed watching my students grow and develop as leaders. They are driving the progress and commercialization of Membrion; it\u2019s truly \u201clearning by doing.\u201d Research-wise, this is a relative new area for me, so that\u2019s exciting as well.\n\n<b>What\u2019s next for Membrion?<\/b>\n\nGN: We\u2019re continuing to work on technical development and refinement. Once we\u2019ve fully transformed our idea into a buyable product, we\u2019ll begin testing it outside of the lab, which is exciting. A long-term objective is to apply our technology to water purification. It\u2019s a larger, more aggressive market, but there\u2019s a lot of potential for impact. Adapting Membrion\u2019s technology to it could be a real game changer.\n\nLearn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/membrion.com\/\">Membrion\u00a0\u00bb<\/a>"},{"title":"UW oceanography senior finds plastic microfibers are common on Puget Sound beaches","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/uw-oceanography-senior-finds-plastic-microfibers-are-common-on-puget-sound-beaches\/","tags":["alumni","college-of-the-environment"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"As part of a yearlong project, Frances Eshom-Arzadon visited 12 Puget Sound beaches to tally the number of nearly invisible bits of plastic, or microplastics.

Residents also may be surprised to learn that polar fleece and other synthetic fibers are the main source of plastic fragments on our beaches.\n\n\u201cPlastics can harm marine life, and can in some cases be the primary cause of death,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/frances-eshom-arzadon-473a2518\/\">Frances Eshom-Arzadon<\/a>, who graduated in June. \u201cSmaller organisms ingest microplastics, and then larger organisms, including humans, consume it indirectly.\u201d\n\nAs part of her <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ocean.washington.edu\/story\/Oceanography_Senior_Thesis\">senior thesis<\/a> project, Eshom-Arzadon visited each location once at the same time in the tidal cycle between November and February. She scraped sediment from an area just below the wrack line, the line of debris left by the high tide. She visited beaches from Tolmie State Park near Olympia, along the Seattle and Everett shorelines and as far out as Port Ludlow on the Olympic Peninsula, a control site far from populated areas.\n\nBack in the lab, Eshom-Arzadon dried the samples, then used chemicals and weight-based techniques to separate the plastic from sand and other material.\n\nHer results show that small plastics are widespread along the shore of Puget Sound. All 12 samples contained microplastics, at an average of 1,776 pieces per 3-foot-square sampling plot. The highest concentration of plastics by number was at Howarth Park in Everett, followed by Carkeek Park and Alki Beach Park in Seattle. The cleanest beaches were at Mukilteo Lighthouse Park and Edmonds Marina Beach, both situated on points of land near ferry terminals.\n\nHer sampling methods followed the procedures established by <a href=\"http:\/\/directory.tacoma.uw.edu\/employee\/jmasura\">Julie Masura<\/a>, a UW Tacoma lecturer who has been tracking marine microplastics in the region for almost a decade.\n\n\u201cPlastics, specifically microplastics, have been found in over 90 percent of the surface samples collected in Puget Sound since 2008,\u201d said Masura, who was not involved in this course. \u201cWe have yet to correlate the presence of plastic and other environmental factors.\u201d\n\nEshom-Arzadon\u2019s project included counting the plastic fragments and classifying them into six types: Styrofoam, fibers, fragments, flakes, films and synthetic sponges. Some 73 percent of the pieces she collected on local beaches were microfibers. These thin strands are not from the breakdown of larger litter, such as plastic bottles or disposable cutlery; rather, they start when fabrics shed fibers that flow out with laundry water after washing synthetic fabrics, like polar fleece or other types of polyester.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to find so many fibers,\u201d Eshom-Arzadon said. \u201cWhen people do laundry, all their effluent with those microfibers is getting washed out. Those fibers come off clothes and get washed out already in the size of microplastics, so they can\u2019t be filtered out.\u201d\n\nShe noted that front-loading machines have been shown to generate <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thesalt\/2017\/02\/06\/511843443\/are-we-eating-our-fleece-jackets-microfibers-are-migrating-into-field-and-food\">fewer microfibers<\/a> in washing water, while Patagonia and other clothing companies have recently begun efforts to produce synthetic fabrics that <a href=\"http:\/\/fusion.net\/story\/316880\/patagonia-tests-its-dirty-microfiber-laundry\/\">shed less fuzz<\/a>.\n\nThe average overall concentration of microplastics was slightly higher on Seattle city beaches, providing only weak support for Eshom-Arzadon\u2019s hypothesis that microplastics would be more common in densely populated areas. But she and her advisers concluded that a one-time sample was probably not enough to properly rank the locations.\n\n\u201cAll of these beaches are cleaned by volunteer groups, and it\u2019s not clear which are cleaned more regularly,\u201d Eshom-Arzadon said. \u201cOcean currents can also carry debris to different places, and can affect how much litter you would find in a one-time sampling.\u201d\n\nEshom-Arzadon became interested in this topic after doing an undergraduate service learning project with the UW-based Coastal Observation and Seabird Survey Team, <a href=\"https:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/coasst\/\">COASST<\/a>. She volunteered to survey beaches around Seattle and her native Edmonds looking for stranded birds and marine debris. She also took an undergraduate class on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/news\/2017\/06\/29\/as-metro-areas-grow-whites-move-farther-from-the-city-center\/\">marine pollution<\/a> that included a section on marine plastics.\n\nTwo other UW oceanography <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ocean.washington.edu\/story\/Senior_Thesis_Symposium_2017\">senior thesis projects<\/a> this year also looked at microplastics. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/ty-mahoney-a77195b4\/\">Ty Mahoney<\/a> sampled microplastics in Hood Canal and faster-flowing waters around Whidbey Island, and found that the debris tends to accumulate in the more stagnant sections. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/gerrad.caldwell\">Gerrad Hofmans<\/a> sampled water from near the source of the glacier-fed Snohomish River down to its mouth in Puget Sound, finding that the concentration of microplastics increases on the way downstream.\n\n\u201cOver the past three years we\u2019ve had a student each year looking at plastics, but Frances is the first student we\u2019ve had that wanted to sample beaches,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ocean.washington.edu\/home\/Kathy+Newell\">Kathy Newell<\/a>, a research scientist in UW School of Oceanography who supervised all three undergraduate research projects. \u201cSome studies suggest plastics accumulate in certain areas. There are so many variables \u2014 tides, winds, currents, time of year \u2014 and there hasn\u2019t been a long-term study on plastics in Puget Sound.\u201d\n\nThose results could help inform the work of Masura and others who are trying to measure and understand plastic pollution locally.\n\n\u201cAs with many research groups, we find that plastics are quite prolific,\u201d Masura said.\n\nHer group is working to develop an interactive map that will display the results of the samples collected with the support of government agencies, colleges, schools and nonprofits.\n\n###\n\nFor more information, contact Eshom-Arzadon at <a href=\"mailto:eshomf@uw.edu\">eshomf@uw.edu<\/a> or 425-501-7018, Masura at 253-692-4317 or <a href=\"mailto:jmasura@uw.edu\">jmasura@uw.edu<\/a>, and Newell at <a href=\"mailto:newell@ocean.washington.edu\">newell@ocean.washington.edu<\/a> or 206-543-6119."},{"title":"From idea to innovation","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/from-idea-to-innovation\/","tags":["engineering","graduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"ME graduate student Jessica Zistatsis shares her journey through the commercialization process at the UW, thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/eih.uw.edu\/\">Engineering Innovation in Health<\/a>.

Rapid-fire speech. Mastery of both affirmative and negative positions on an issue. These are the hallmarks of a great college debater. For most students, these skills take years to hone. Then there\u2019s Victoria Braun.\n\nBraun, a UW communication major, joined <a href=\"http:\/\/www.com.washington.edu\/debate\/\">the University of Washington Debate Union<\/a> (UWDU) her senior year, inspired by a course on political debate taught by Michael Souders, UWDU director and lecturer in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.com.washington.edu\/\">Department of Communication<\/a>. With no previous experience, Braun began training for competitions in the novice division. At the first event, she lost most of her debates. But by her fourth and final competition, the national <a href=\"http:\/\/cedadebate.org\/about\">Cross-Examination Debate Association<\/a> (CEDA) tournament, Braun was polished and confident. She and a partner from James Madison University (JMU) earned the title of 2017 Novice National Champions.\n\nThe win was no fluke, says Souders. \u201cAfter losing 75 percent of her debates in that first tournament, Victoria stuck with it,\u201d he says. \u201cShe did more practice debates than any novice competitor I have ever had. Joining the UWDU as a senior with no prior experience took a lot of guts, but she\u2019s made the absolute most of her time at UW and in debate.\u201d\n\nSouders revived the long-dormant debate team in 2013 with private support from Kurt Carlson and Propel Insurance. A gift from Maggie Walker has enabled UWDU to continue its work, which includes sponsorship of on-campus discussions, outreach to the community, and of course the participation of UW students in regional and national debate tournaments. Along with Braun\u2019s stellar CEDA win, the UWDU varsity team finished 17th\u00a0in the national CEDA tournament, only losing to the eventual national champions.\n\nBefore and during the competitive season, debaters devote considerable time to the team. They thoroughly research the year\u2019s overarching topic\u00a0\u2014\u00a0this year it was climate change\u00a0\u2014\u00a0to prepare for any argument introduced by the opposing team. When Braun realized the commitment required, she thought twice about participating. \u201cI called my mom and said, \u2018This is going to be the hardest thing in my life. Do I really want to do this my senior year?\u2019\u201d Braun recalls. \u201cI was so torn.\u201d\n\nOnce she committed, Braun discovered that she not only loved debate but also benefited academically from the experience. \u201cIt pushed me way out of my comfort zone and taught me so much,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen writing papers, I notice I now start out as if I was going into a debate. It helps me structure my thoughts. And in classes, I raise my hand and participate more.\u201d\n\nAs much as Braun appreciates debate prep, she relishes competing even more. Tournaments often involve a long day of travel followed by a 12-hour day of debate, with up to eight rounds against other impressive teams. \u201cI get nervous before competing, but in round you don\u2019t have time to be nervous,\u201d Braun says. \u201cThere\u2019s a moment when the other team starts talking and you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to say. It\u2019s the end of the day and you\u2019ve spent ten hours thinking critically, thinking on your feet. You need to slow down for a second and think through things, to piece together what you need to say to counter your opponents. Of course, there are also moments when you have to wing it.\u00a0 It\u2019s crazy, but it\u2019s fun.\u201d\n\nAt the CEDA tournament, Braun and her JMU partner Abhis Sedhai debated varsity, junior varsity, and novice teams to make it into the novice finals, where they earned the title of 2017 Novice National Champions. Braun credits Sedhai\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the two were paired when Braun\u2019s UW partner was unable to attend the CEDA tournament\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and her UW and JMU teammates with making the championship win possible. JV and varsity members who didn\u2019t move on in the tournament gladly helped Braun prepare for her next round. \u201cThe camaraderie on the team is really great,\u201d she says. \u201c\u201dEveryone is so willing to help out a teammate. I met so many brilliant people I would normally never meet.\u201d\n\nBraun also credits Souders and assistant coach James Stevenson for their leadership and guidance, and donors to the program for covering travel costs and competition fees. Like others involved with debate, she would like to see more funding for the UWDU.\n\n\u201cIf we had to cover our own travel expenses, I don\u2019t think any of us would be able to go to tournaments,\u201d says Braun, who attended the UW through a Husky Promise scholarship. \u201cMore support would mean we could attend more tournaments. Some East Coast schools, where debate is much stronger, offer debate scholarships and travel to tournaments every weekend.\u201d\n\nAs Braun prepares to graduate, she is unsure what comes next. But thanks to her UW education\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and especially her debate experience \u2014\u00a0she feels prepared for life after graduation.\n\n\u201cDeciding to do this crazy thing, to do debate, and discovering that I was really good at it, I have so much more confidence now,\u201d says Braun. \u201cIt\u2019s made me so much stronger. The UW brought that out in me.\u201d\n\n<i>Interested in supporting the UW Debate Union?

Now she's a UW graduate pursuing a PhD in astronomy and astrophysics.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, June 2017)\n\nLupita Tovar\u2019s life hasn\u2019t gone as planned.\n\nThe first in her extended family to finish high school, Tovar never expected to go on to a four-year college. She never imagined majoring in astronomy and physics, participating in research, presenting at conferences, or being published in academic journals. She assumed study abroad was for other students. Being honored as one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/husky100\/\">Husky 100<\/a> and accepted to PhD programs? Unthinkable.\n\nYet as a UW undergraduate,\u00a0Tovar has done all those things and more. After graduation, she will continue at the UW as a PhD student in astronomy and astrobiology.\n\nAs a teen in Kennewick, Washington, Tovar figured she\u2019d get a job close to home after high school. What changed her mind was <a href=\"https:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/reach\/events-and-programs\/fall-conferences\/e-e-e-conference\/\">Esperanza En Educaci\u00f3n<\/a>, a one-day conference at the UW designed to encourage Latinx\u00a0high school seniors to pursue higher education. Organized by the <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/reach\/\">Multicultural Outreach and Recruitment<\/a> team in the UW Office of Minority Affairs &amp; Diversity (OMA&amp;D), the conference featured UW student ambassadors sharing their own Husky experiences.\n\n\u201cI remember talking to a student ambassador who was involved in so many things on campus,\u201d Tovar says. \u201cI thought that was incredible. But I told myself not to fall in love with the UW because it\u2019s super competitive to get into. I didn\u2019t want to be disappointed.\u201d\n\nTovar did get in, with NASA Space Grant and Educational Opportunity Program scholarships easing the financial burden. For emotional support, she turned to the UW\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/omadcs\/camp\/\">College Assistance Migrant Program<\/a> (CAMP). \u201cThere was a huge culture shock coming to the UW, with only seven percent of the students being Latinx,\u201d says Tovar. \u201cCAMP became my home away from home, that little comfort zone with people who look like you, have similar backgrounds, and share similar stories. It was instrumental during my first year.\u201d\n\nA CAMP advisor helped Tovar register for freshman courses. Tovar planned on majoring in business, but her advisor pointed her toward a fall quarter seminar, the <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/premap\/\">Pre-majors in Astronomy Program<\/a> (Pre-MAP), that would prove instrumental in shaping Tovar\u2019s academic career. The seminar, offered by the Department of Astronomy, introduces first-year students to scientific research. Tovar admits she had no idea what she was getting into when she signed up. \u201cRight away we were reading scientific articles and coding, filling up our toolbox with tools we\u2019d need to do a research project,\u201d Tovar recalls. \u201cI felt like I had\u00a0been dropped into the middle of the ocean. It was all brand new.\u201d\n\nSix weeks into the quarter, each pre-MAP student was paired with a graduate student mentor and a faculty member on a research project. Tovar worked with PhD student Giada Arney in the Virtual Planetary Lab of astronomy professor Victoria Meadows. At the end of the quarter, Meadows invited Tovar to continue with her research team. \u201cThat\u2019s when I dropped the idea of a business major,\u201d says Tovar.\n\nParticipants in the Pre-MAP seminar present their research to department faculty at the end of the quarter. That experience was daunting for Tovar, but great preparation for what was to come. The following winter Tovar presented her ongoing research \u2014 on the spectral effects of clouds and hazes on Earth-like planets \u2014 at an American Astronomical Society conference, answering questions in a poster session and networking with professionals. She would later be an author on two research papers published in academic journals.\n\nTovar\u00a0also took a leap of another kind \u2014 all the way to Europe. She signed up for a spring quarter study abroad program in Rome, led by an\u00a0astronomy professor and an\u00a0art history graduate student.\u00a0Tovar\u00a0had never imagined herself studying abroad, but the astronomy connection was a perfect fit. The program focused on astronomy, art history, and religion in Rome over two millennia.\n\n\u201cIn the family I grew up in, you don\u2019t just go to Italy for 10 weeks,\u201d says\u00a0Tovar. \u201dThat was a whole new experience. It opened my eyes to a new world perspective and got me to explore areas beyond astronomy, but also to see how astronomy has evolved over time. And being Catholic, it was a blessing to go to the Vatican and see the Pope. It was a memorable\u00a0experience.\u201d\n\nThat\u00a0study abroad was one of many UW experiences\u00a0Tovar\u00a0has shared with prospective and first-year students as a peer mentor for the CAMP program and as a student ambassador for the Multicultural Outreach and Recruitment team.\u00a0 Both programs had been instrumental in\u00a0Tovar\u2019s UW experience, and she wanted to encourage others just as she had been encouraged.\n\n\u201cBeing able to pay it forward to programs that made such a difference in my life has been a blessing,\u201d says\u00a0Tovar. \u201cAnd sometimes you learn just as much as the students you are mentoring. Hearing the stories of students who come from a similar background to mine reminds me why I\u2019m here, too.\u201d\n\nTovar\u00a0will be here quite a while longer. Before her senior year, she spent a summer at the\u00a0Banneker\u00a0Institute at the Harvard Center for Astrophysics, an experience that convinced her to pursue a PhD. The\u00a0Ronald E. McNair Post-Baccalaureate Program provided support and guidance in navigating the application process. She was accepted to three graduate programs in astronomy and chose the UW for its strength in\u00a0astrobiology. But before she starts the program, she looks forward to receiving her bachelor\u2019s degree with her supportive family cheering her on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all of my family graduating with me,\u201d says\u00a0Tovar. \u201cMy parents emigrated from Mexico and have worked very hard so their children could have opportunities for a better life. They are my biggest inspiration and have always told me an education is something no one can take from you. This has been a huge accomplishment for them as well as for me.\u201d\n\n<i>To learn how you can provide scholarship support to students like\u00a0Lupita, visit\u00a0the College's <\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/artsci.washington.edu\/campaign\/priorities\"><i>website <\/i><\/a><i>or contact Jessica\u00a0Frederick at 206-616-3253 or\u00a0<\/i><a href=\"mailto:jessimay@uw.edu\"><i>jessimay@uw.edu<\/i><\/a><i>.<\/i>"},{"title":"Embracing the world, one language at a time","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/embracing-the-world-one-language-at-a-time\/","tags":["arts-sciences","giving","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"For Martin Horst, with majors in French and linguistics, language is a bridge to other cultures.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, June 2017)\n\nIt started with a scheduling conflict. As a high school freshman in second-year French, Martin Horst had intended to take French 3 the following year. But a conflict required him to jump to French 4. He found he was able to manage the advanced material with aplomb. \u201cIt turned out that language was one of my strengths,\u201d he says.\n\nEvidently so. Horst, now a UW senior majoring in French and linguistics, received two UW merit scholarships \u2014 the UW Honors Program Friedman-Hechter Merit Scholarship and the UW Fritz Merit Scholarship for Study Abroad Students \u2014 and is among this year\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/husky100\/\">Husky 100<\/a>, an honor that recognizes students who have made the most of their time at the UW. Horst has studied abroad, participated in language research, served as a peer mentor for the UW Honors Program, and found time for ultimate Frisbee, serving as co-captain of the UW Ultimate Frisbee B-Team this year.\n\nHorst credits passionate teachers with getting him hooked on language. First there was Roslyn Cooper, a French teacher (now retired) at Seattle\u2019s Ingraham High School, who introduced students to Francophone cultures in France, North Africa, Canada, and the Caribbean. \u201cThat cultural aspect was really interesting to me,\u201d says Horst. \u201cShe was always encouraging us to find French in our lives, whether it was watching French movies or finding French books.\u201d\n\nAt the UW, Horst was drawn to the Department of French and Italian Studies, but he also became interested in linguistics thanks to a course taught by Laura McGarrity, senior lecturer in the Department of Linguistics. \u201cShe was able to connect the things we were learning in class to things outside,\u201d Horst says. \u201cWhen you have instructors who are able to make those connections, you understand the material so much better.\u201d\n\nIt helps that Horst has a natural affinity for language. He is interested in how language works but also how it bridges cultures, allowing us to communicate with people from vastly different backgrounds. He experienced that firsthand during a year-long study abroad at Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane, Morocco through the UW\u2019s Direct Exchange Program.\n\n\u201cIt was a life-changing experience,\u201d Horst says. \u201cI\u2019m from Seattle, so the UW is a ten-minute car ride from home. This was my first experience living in a different city\u00a0<i>ever<\/i>. Being thrown into a totally different culture after spending my entire life here was a huge change.\u201d\n\nHorst took intensive Arabic the summer before his study abroad, spending five days a week learning Arabic script, language, and culture. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to show up there and not be able to communicate,\u201d he says. \u201cI finished my Arabic final on a Thursday and left for Morocco the following Monday. I barely had time to say my goodbyes.\u201d\n\nA year later Horst was immersed in another language and culture with even less preparation. While in Morocco, he heard about an upcoming nine-month research assistantship in Madrid \u2014 no Spanish proficiency required\u00a0\u2014\u00a0through the <a href=\"http:\/\/ilabs.washington.edu\/\">UW Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences<\/a>. He applied and was accepted along with 15 other students. He spent the following year in a Madrid preschool, immersing children of different ages in English language through play, and then measuring how much English they learned and the processes behind that acquisition.\n\nThat experience led Horst to pursue more research opportunities. Back at the UW, he worked on the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/zeos.ling.washington.edu\/~PNWEnglish\/projectdescription.html\">English in the Pacific Northwest Project<\/a>, led by linguistics professor Alicia\u00a0Wassink, which explores how different\u00a0sociocultural\u00a0communities are shaping the Pacific Northwest dialect of English. \u201cI discovered that learning from faculty, collaborating with academics, was something I really enjoy,\u201d says Horst. \u201cThat project solidified my grad school aspirations. I want to continue doing research.\u201d\n\nWhile a career in academia is Horst\u2019s long-term goal, he has other plans for the near future. After graduating, he will work at\u00a0Lindamood-Bell\u00a0Learning Processes, Inc., which helps children and adults with reading disabilities improve their reading using research-based language techniques. \u201cI enjoy working with kids, especially one-on-one,\u201d says Horst. \u201cI\u2019m passionate about tutoring, mentoring, and teaching. It sometimes\u00a0doesn\u2019t even feel like work.\u201d\n\nHorst plans to continue working with children, teaching English in schools near Paris through the Teaching Assistant Program in France. He then hopes to pursue a PhD in French or linguistics, with the goal of inspiring the next generation as he has been inspired. Wherever he ends up, Horst believes his newfound confidence and his knowledge of multiple languages will be a huge advantage, personally as well as professionally.\n\n\u201cI am no longer scared of that which is unfamiliar, because language has been my bridge to compassion and understanding others,\u201d says Horst. \u201cI think Nelson Mandela said it best: \u2018If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart.\u2019 This statement has inspired me to reach out into the world, to become a fearless globetrotter. I could not have done this when I started at the UW, but now I have grown into someone who can.\u201d\n\n<i>To learn how you can provide scholarship support to students like Martin, visit the College's\u00a0<\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/artsci.washington.edu\/campaign\/priorities\"><i>website\u00a0<\/i><\/a><i>or contact\u00a0Jessica\u00a0Frederick at 206-616-3253 or\u00a0<\/i><a href=\"mailto:jessimay@uw.edu\"><i>jessimay@uw.edu<\/i><\/a><i>.<\/i>"},{"title":"Where will meets way","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/where-will-meets-way\/","tags":["foster-school-of-business","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"For Yakima-born Yesenia Velasquez, the Young Executives of Color program at the Foster School of Business has opened the door to a promising future she never knew existed.","content":"(UW homepage, June 2017)\n\n<b>From her first day of kindergarten, Yesenia Velasquez knew that she would have to work harder than the other kids.<\/b>\n\nShe started school without many advantages, save for wit and genuine grit. Her parents had immigrated to the Yakima Valley from Jalisco, Mexico, before she was born. To make a life in the United States, they worked hard at thankless jobs \u2014 Gonzalo forged bricks and Catalina packed produce.\n\nBut they wanted more for their three daughters.\n\n\u201cMy parents always taught me that education is the key to success,\u201d says Velasquez. \u201cThat\u2019s what made me an independent learner. I\u2019ve always craved education.\u201d\n\nThat craving eventually led her to participate in the rigorous Running Start program in high school. The flexible schedule allowed her to work longer shifts at McDonald\u2019s, where she earned enough to afford some of the \u201cextras\u201d that many teenagers take for granted: school clothes, textbooks, band travel, graphing calculators.\n\nBut no matter how much she learned or how well she did in school, college looked no less expensive or intimidating to Velasquez. Besides, what would she study? Growing up in a working-class Hispanic community, she saw most career possibilities as abstract at best. Maybe law or medicine? She had never even heard of accounting.\n\nThen she discovered the Young Executives of Color (YEOC) program at the University of Washington Foster School of Business.\n\n<b>Ambition unlocked<\/b>\n\nA partnership between the Foster School and the professional services firm EY (formerly Ernst &amp; Young), YEOC is a nine-month program that provides an introduction to business careers, professional development, college preparation and mentoring to some of the most promising high school students from underrepresented minority communities around the state. The goal is to unlock potential, offer opportunity and, ultimately, to expand prosperity.\n\nOne Saturday each month throughout her senior year, Velasquez woke up at 4 a.m. to make the several-hour journey to Seattle, sometimes escorted by her family, sometimes alone on the bus. These treks were richly rewarded with practical information and profound inspiration.\n\n\u201cNo matter the trouble to get there,\u201d she says, \u201cit was worth it.\u201d\n\nHearing stories from each session\u2019s featured speaker \u2014 senior executives who look like and come from similar backgrounds as many of the students \u2014 Velasquez began to visualize what she could become. Even the location stirred the soul.\n\nHer first YEOC session was the first time she\u2019d visited a college campus. \u201cIt was amazing,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWalking into the giant atrium of PACCAR Hall and thinking, \u2018OK, this is possible. I can see myself here.\u2019\u201d\n\n<b>Making the most of an opportunity<\/b>\n\nAnd here she is. Velasquez earned her place at the UW and the Foster School, where she has flourished. With ongoing support from the school\u2019s office of Undergraduate Diversity Services and a mosaic of scholarships \u2014 donated by EY, Microsoft and Costco, among other organizations \u2014 she has been able to engage fully at the UW and beyond.\n\nVelasquez serves in leadership roles at the Association of Latino Professionals for America and in the Kappa Delta Chi cultural sorority. She has also represented the UW at the Indiana University Kelley School of Business National Diversity Case Competition, and she has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/global\/opportunities\/#yesenia\">studied abroad in Morocco<\/a>.\n\nHer Foster education has continued to open doors. Perhaps most significantly, Velasquez landed an internship at EY after her first year on campus. After rotating between the firm\u2019s audit, advisory and tax practices for the past two summers, she is spending this summer as a national tax intern, working with some of EY\u2019s largest clients.\n\n\u201cYesenia brings a can-do positivity that shows up in everything she does,\u201d says EY recruiter Katie Campbell. \u201cShe\u2019s already proven herself to be smart, driven and hardworking. We believe she can do anything she sets her mind to.\u201d\n\n<b>From mentee to mentor<\/b>\n\nNow an incoming senior at the UW with a clear path to success that is unprecedented in her family, Velasquez has returned to YEOC as a mentor. She brings that positivity \u2014 and a wealth of wisdom \u2014 to high school students searching for their own futures.\n\n\u201cYesenia wants to follow those in front of her and help others behind her,\u201d says Pamela Lacson, associate director of Foster\u2019s Undergraduate Diversity Services. \u201cThis is what sets YEOC apart: having mentors who look like her, who provide real answers and real possibilities to young people who have the drive but lack the social capital that comes with a lineage of college education.\u201d\n\nVelasquez sees mentoring as the first installment of a lifelong payback plan. From that first day of school, she has remained motivated both by her own expectations and by the pride and pressures of her family. \u201cMy parents came from nothing and worked so hard for me to have these opportunities,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to pay them back. I want to make them proud.\u201d\n\nReflecting on her family\u2019s efforts, she muses, \u201cEvery now and then, it hits me. I\u2019m in college. I work in a skyscraper. I\u2019ve been to New York and San Francisco and Morocco \u2014 all of these things I could never have imagined when I was in middle school. No matter how hard I worked, I wouldn\u2019t be where I am without YEOC.\u201d\n\n<b>YEOC: Mission and history<\/b>\n\nThe Young Executives of Color program was established at the University of Washington Foster School of Business in 2006. Its mission is to cultivate the academic potential of underrepresented high school student leaders in Washington state.\n\nYEOC began with 36 students from 17 high schools. In the 2016\u201317 academic year, the partnership with the professional services firm EY brought 170 sophomores, juniors and seniors from 75 high schools around the state to the Foster campus one Saturday a month.\n\nWhile YEOC helps increase access to excellence at the UW, the pipeline program helps cultivate leaders who attend college all over the state \u2014 and the country. Says Lacson, \u201cHistorically, 100 percent of our high school seniors have gone on to college. They not only go to the UW, but they are getting into schools across the country. That\u2019s a win for the business community and for college access.\u201d\n\n<b>Fostering diversity<\/b>\n\nEY doesn\u2019t just underwrite the UW Foster School\u2019s Young Executives of Color program. It also provides volunteers, recruits high-level executives as keynote speakers, delivers professional development exercises and offers invaluable consulting on curriculum, topics and activities.\n\n\u201cThe mission of YEOC aligns with EY's passion for promoting equity in the workforce \u2014 championing diversity and inclusiveness \u2014 which is at the very heart of EY's values,\u201d says Christian Tinder, \u201999, a principal in EY\u2019s advisory practice and the firm\u2019s coordinating partner with the UW."},{"title":"'Learning by doing' key tenet of SPH program","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/learning-by-doing-key-tenet-of-sph-program\/","tags":["graduate-student","public-health"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"Learning by doing is a central tenant of the Community-Oriented Public Health Practice program.

The folding cards have space for youth to fill in their name, gender identity, sexual orientation and pronoun, plus a tear-off panel for health care providers with tips on providing sensitive care to queer and trans youth. Since graduating in 2013, Shimkin has continued to build the Q Card Project, distributing 125,000 little pink cards in three languages to youth, schools, libraries, community organizations and others who interact with LGBTQ young people.\n\nShimkin attributes much of the Q Card\u2019s success to the skills and contacts gained through the COPHP program.\n\n\"The greatest gift that COPHP gave a lot of us was a sort of a fearlessness,\u201d Shimkin said. \u201cCOPHP said, \u2018Hop in and learn how to do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nLearning by doing is a central tenant of COPHP. More formally, the program\u2019s teaching approach is called \u201cproblem-based learning.\u201d Rooted in adult learning theory, problem-based learning requires students to actively engage in solving real problems.\n\nNow COPHP faculty have published a book to help other schools of public health incorporate the problem-based learning model that COPHP has refined over 16 years.\n\n\u201cExperiential Teaching for Public Health Practice: Using Cases in Problem-Based Learning,\u201d edited by Bud Nicola and Amy Hagopian, details the elements of a successful problem-based learning program and shows how the techniques can be used to teach core curricular content. The book, available for free download from <a href=\"http:\/\/ebooks.benthamscience.com\/book\/9781681083872\/\">Bentham eBooks<\/a>, also includes extensive appendices to help implement this unique way of teaching.\n\n\u201cIt's very difficult to move from a lecture-based model into something that's very active like problem-based learning,\u201d said Nicola, an affiliate professor in the Department of Health Services who helped design the COPHP program. \u201cIt takes a lot of courage, and it takes some guidance. This book provides the guidance.\"\n\nCOPHP was originally coached by faculty at Drexel University\u2019s School of Public Health, who were pioneers of problem-based learning in U.S. public health education for graduate students. Some medical and business schools and K\u201312 institutions also use the approach.\n\n\"We\u2019d really like other schools to try this, and not just in public health,\u201d said Amy Hagopian, associate professor of Health Services and Global Health, and director of the COPHP program. \u201cWe think higher education should be moving in this direction.\"\n\nWhat sets COPHP apart from other public health programs is that students work on \u201creal projects that have real deliverables for real clients,\u201d Hagopian said. \u201cSo they learn all the weirdnesses of working with clients who might be unclear about what they really want or vague on various aspects of their project.\u201d\n\nStudents work together in small groups to design the steps needed to navigate the problems posed in the cases, which include both hypothetical examples drawn from actual public health situations and real projects for agencies and community groups. Students take turns facilitating the groups, so that they build essential skills working in and leading groups, and in interpersonal communications. Faculty mainly provide coaching and feedback, and strive to \u201ckeep their mouth shut while the students struggle,\u201d Nicola said.\n\nSuch team-based problem-solving mimics how workplaces operate, said COPHP alumna Hilary Heishman (MPH, 07). Faculty \u201cdon\u2019t give you that much information \u2014 you have to figure it out and draw in expertise from various sources,\u201d said Heishman, now a senior program officer with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. \u201cAnd that completely matches my life in all my roles since then.\"\n\n\"COPHP really prepared me for real-world work in public health,\u201d Heishman said, \u201cand not only public health, because what it taught us was skills and a way of thinking that are widely applicable.\"\n\nFor second-year COPHP student Francesca Collins, completing projects for client organizations helped her develop skills she didn\u2019t know she was capable of \u2014 and with them, new confidence in her abilities. \"I've done so many things I never imagined I would do,\" she said.\n\nFor her capstone, Collins researched and developed an intrauterine device self-removal guide with the UW\u2019s Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Family Planning. \"I never thought of myself as a strong math and science person until I was able to accomplish some challenging projects in this program that were beyond my experience level and comfort zone,\u201d Collins said. \u201cIt opened doors that I wasn't expecting.\"\n\nCOPHP faculty members Nicola and Hagopian realize that most schools of public health are unlikely to make a wholesale switch to problem-based learning, but their book offers ideas for incorporating cases, problems and projects into existing programs.

One where tiny computers full of information live in our pockets. Where boarding passes are printed at touch-screen kiosks and groceries are paid for at touch-screen card readers. A world where extending a finger and making contact with a particular point gets us what we want.\n\nWell, except for the millions of us across the world who experience motor impairments \u2014 the millions of us who are being left behind.\n\n<strong>The many definitions of \u201ctouch\u201d <\/strong>\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure if you went around and asked, \u2018Hey, what do you think a touch is?\u2019, you might get different answers, but it would probably converge around something that looks like <em>this<\/em>,\u201d says Martez Mott, raising his pointer finger before tapping it on the table in front of him. \u201cFor the participants in my studies, that was not the case at all.\u201d\n\nMott is a Ph.D. candidate in the UW\u2019s Information School and an active member of the philanthropy-supported MAD (Mobile + Accessible Design) Lab and the DUB (Design. Use. Build.) Group, where his research centers on making touch screens accessible for people who live with motor impairments, from cerebral palsy to muscular dystrophy to Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\n\u201cTouch screens were developed for a certain type of use,\u201d says Mott, who received financial support through the University of Washington Graduate Opportunity Award. It\u2019s simple: If you want to interact with something on your device, you have to be able to extend a finger and touch it cleanly and accurately. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything else is relegated to some other type of functionality \u2014 if you touch your phone with two fingers, it thinks you\u2019re trying to zoom.\u201d\n\nFor those who live with cerebral palsy, however, touch might look like patting the screen with the back of the hand, or dragging a palm or a fist. \u201cWhen that happens, the screen picks up a big blobby area,\u201d says the Detroit native, \u201cand the system has no idea what to do with it.\u201d\n\nYet.\n\n<strong>Say hello to Smart Touch: calibration software for touch-screen accessibility <\/strong>\n\nImagine a system that adapts to touch \u2014 whatever that might look like. Enter: Smart Touch. The project is a work in progress, constantly being tested and tuned by Mott and a small team of researchers, including his advisor, Associate Professor Jacob Wobbrock.\n\nThe objective? To get touch-screen access to a level where anybody can pick up a device and, with a simple calibration procedure, be able to use it right out of the box without needing additional specialized technologies.\n\nThink of it as the counterpart to automated speech recognition, where the device asks you to repeat a few phrases so it can pick up on your unique speech patterns. In Mott\u2019s model, the device asks you to touch a couple targets \u2014 a balloon or a bull\u2019s-eye, for example \u2014 so it can pick up on your unique <em>touch<\/em> patterns and adjust how it responds.\n\nAnd it\u2019s all guided by Mott\u2019s participants, who give him real-life, real-time feedback.\n\n<strong>Making Smart Touch a reality \u2014 with real-life users <\/strong>\n\nTwo years ago, at the start of the project, Mott lugged a huge, table-sized Microsoft Surface into Provail: a local center that helps people with disabilities pursue the lives they want to live. Among the nonprofit\u2019s many offerings? Computer classes \u2014 and lots of motivated learners willing to participate in his study.\n\nThere, Mott worked with eight volunteers to make Smart Touch a reality, beginning by asking them to hit targets on the screen. \u201cI had a wide range of participants, so I saw a wide range of strategies used to complete the tasks,\u201d he says. The first person would prop one hand on the tablet for support while dragging the other hand across the screen. The next person would interact with the device in an entirely different way. This, says Mott, is why inclusive innovation \u2014 actually looping the software\u2019s target population into the design process \u2014 is so important.\n\n\u201cWhen people are motivated to use a technology, they\u2019ll employ a lot of different strategies in order for that to become possible. It was difficult to get an understanding of what \u2018touch\u2019 looks like,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople used the software in ways I couldn\u2019t have predicted, which resulted in a lot of failure \u2014\u00a0and fixing \u2014 for me.\u201d\n\n<strong>Touch screens, everywhere<\/strong>\n\nFailure is part of the learning process, and now \u2014 \u201cafter a <em>lot<\/em> of learning,\u201d says Mott, laughing \u2014 he has a system up and running. And as he creates newer versions of Smart Touch over the next few years, retooling algorithms to improve accuracy and creating better designs for performance gains, the iterations will only get better.\n\n\u201cThe hope is that you could buy a device, turn on an accessibility setting, and then go through a calibration procedure for better touch performance so you can use your phone or tablet however <em>you<\/em> like,\u201d says Mott, who\u2019s slated to wrap up his dissertation by 2019\n\n\u201cThis research isn\u2019t just a theoretical contribution; it\u2019s a practical one,\u201d he says. \u201cHearing my participants tell me how important and impactful this work can be in their daily lives is the most rewarding thing. It\u2019s what drives me.\u201d\n\nAnd as far as rolling it into the market? That\u2019s a few years away, but Mott has a vision \u2014 starting with buy-in from the tech industry. \u201cI would love to see every touch-enabled device \u2014 public or private \u2014 be accessible, with this technology integrated into every operating system, quietly running in the background. I want to see a check-out kiosk at the grocery store embedded with intelligence that can infer people\u2019s behaviors based on their unique touch,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can do it.

Thanks to the generosity of donors like you, both Wething and Fowle received scholarships that enable them to focus on academic pursuits and research with real-world influence: Wething studies the effects of Seattle\u2019s historic minimum wage law, and Fowle is working to find evidence-based solutions to reduce poverty in developing countries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The City of Seattle Minimum Wage Study<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In January 2014, Seattle made history when it became the first major city in the U.S. to adopt a $15 minimum wage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When the new law took effect the following year, policymakers were entering uncharted waters, as were workers and businesses. No one knew how the increase would play out with real people in the real world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With the rest of the nation watching to see how it would unfold \u2014 and waiting to see if they should follow suit \u2014 the City of Seattle contracted with an interdisciplinary team of UW faculty from the Evans School, the School of Social Work and the School of Public Health to conduct a <a href=\"http:\/\/evans.uw.edu\/policy-impact\/minimum-wage-study\"><span class=\"s2\">multi-year study<\/span><\/a> of the new law and its effects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For researchers at the Evans School, the wage increase presented an unprecedented opportunity: the ability to track and study the effects of a new policy in real time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cOften when you\u2019re studying public policy, you either come in after a policy has been implemented, or your team helps design a program and then studies it from the beginning,\u201d explains <a href=\"http:\/\/evans.uw.edu\/profile\/hill\"><span class=\"s2\">Heather Hill<\/span><\/a>, an associate professor at the Evans School and co-investigator for the study. \u201cBut this is different. We get to evaluate as it happens.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As the new wages were implemented, the researchers tracked potential bellwethers of the law\u2019s impact, including wages, the number of hours employees worked and the prices of local goods.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But numbers can only say so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhile administrative data will give comprehensive results about changes in the number of jobs and hours worked, it doesn\u2019t tell us how workers affected by the minimum wage view their quality of life,\u201d explains Hilary Wething, a Ph.D. student at the Evans School and member of the Minimum Wage Study.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Wething, Hill and a team of other UW students make up a subgroup of the Minimum Wage Study aimed at collecting qualitative data related to the adoption of the new law.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Over two years, their team conducted interviews with 55 local low-income workers, all of whom were working for no more than $15 per hour. All 55 participants have children. At the start of the study, all were working for no more than $15 per hour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Beyond hours worked or tips received, the workers divulged more detailed and complex aspects of their lives. \u201cWe asked how well their work hours fit with their family life, what works about that and what doesn't,\u201d explains Wething. \u201cWe asked questions that allowed them to provide a lot of detail that otherwise wouldn\u2019t be given.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Wething previously worked primarily with quantitative data on low-wage work, and was surprised by the intimate nature of qualitative research.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Hearing people\u2019s stories was not only moving, it also provided a lot of context about the perspective they bring to their work lives and how they view their roles as a parent, she says.<\/span><span class=\"s3\"><b>The Evans School Policy Analysis &amp; Research Group<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Evans School is a policy partner with impact far beyond the city of Seattle. By partnering with local and international development organizations, students at the Evans School are able to reach and influence global communities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Reducing poverty around the world is graduate student Matthew Fowle\u2019s dream. As a student researcher with the <a href=\"http:\/\/evans.uw.edu\/policy-impact\/epar\"><span class=\"s2\">Evans School Policy Analysis &amp; Research Group<\/span><\/a> (EPAR), he's looking for evidence-based solutions to the problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Fowle, an MPA candidate at the Evans School, was fairly young when he first decided to work for a more equitable world.

So many Indians commented on the abundance of Soviet books during the Cold War era that Bachman decided it was a topic worth exploring. \u00a0Last summer she finally had her chance, thanks to a <a href=\"https:\/\/simpsoncenter.org\/programs\/public-scholarship\/reimagining-phd\/public-projects\">Mellon Summer Fellowship for Public Projects in the Humanities<\/a>, awarded by the UW's <a href=\"https:\/\/simpsoncenter.org\/\">Simpson Center for the Humanities<\/a>.\n\nThe Mellon Summer Fellowship supports graduate student research that engages public audiences. Bachman, now a graduate student in the UW <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/history\/\">Department of History<\/a>, created an exhibit for Suzzallo Library about cultural connections between the Soviet Union and India during the Cold War era. \"Bollywood and Bolsheviks: Indo-Soviet Collaboration in Literature and Film, 1954-1991\" will be on view in Suzzallo\u2019s Allen Library lobby through May 31. The College of Arts &amp; Sciences provided additional funding for the project.\n\nBachman explains that in the years after Joseph Stalin\u2019s death, the Soviet Union made a concerted effort to distribute books to India and many other postcolonial nations, offering the books at low or no cost. \u201cThe Soviets translated texts from all the different Soviet languages into 13 Indian languages, including English,\u201d says Bachman. \u201cThey had the largest translation program in the world. There were books about science and technology, books about the natural world, novels, folktales, and more. One of my hosts in India still remembers writing to Kremlin No. 9 to request books as a child, and then receiving beautiful Soviet books in the mail for free.\u201d\n\nOne might assume that the Soviet Union\u2019s efforts to translate and distribute its books widely was politically motivated. That was partially true, but Bachman believes the effort went beyond politics and reflected the Soviet Union\u2019s genuine interest in protecting and supporting the diversity of national linguistic identities in the world.\n\n\u201cYou cannot simply boil this down to the word \u2018propaganda,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cOf course there were translations of Marx and Engels and Lenin, but that was just one publisher. There were dozens of other publishers producing a wide variety of books, as you can see in the exhibit. They wanted people to read books in their own languages.\u201d\n\n<hr \/>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Cold War...is seen as a time when the Soviet Union was isolated from the world, but as the exhibit demonstrates, that was simply not the case.\n\n<hr \/>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe exhibit features two \u201cliving rooms,\u201d one Russian and one Indian, where visitors can relax and peruse books translated and published by the Soviet Union for Indian readers. Bachman found some of the books in used bookstores in India and ordered others from publishers who still have them in stock. A few books are on loan from private collectors. The exhibit also includes displays about the cultural exchange between the Soviet Union and India, and a tablet computer that offers clips from some of Bachman\u2019s interviews for the project. She interviewed more than two dozen people in the U.S., India, and Russia, ranging from a book translator in Russia to a UW pathologist who recalls how reading Soviet books as a child in India sparked her interest in science.\n\nThose memories are powerful and have inspired at least half a dozen Facebook groups about Soviet books translated into Indian languages. For some Indian families with little money, the availability of inexpensive Soviet books meant they could finally build a library in their home. \u201cThese books were heavily subsidized,\u201d says Bachman. \u201cThis was not a profit-driven enterprise. They were cheap enough that Indians who had never been able to afford books before could suddenly buy books. And because the books were translated into vernacular languages, grandparents who didn\u2019t speak English were able to read to their grandchildren.\u201d\n\nWhile the impact of Soviet books in India was significant, the cultural exchange went both ways. Bollywood films from India were massively popular in the USSR and led to joint productions between studios in India and many of the Soviet Socialist Republics. Bachman\u2019s exhibit includes a documentary film about Bollywood cinema in Russia, featuring clips from Soviet-era Bollywood films and excerpts from Bachman\u2019s conversations with Bollywood film directors and actors from that period. Emma Hinchliffe, a doctoral student in history, produced the documentary.\n\nDespite her trips to Russia\u00a0and India and more than two dozen interviews, Bachman feels there is still more to learn about this topic. She wonders, for example, what sort of responses Soviet publishers received after providing an address for feedback on the back of every translated book they distributed. \u201cI know anecdotally that there were many responses,\u201d Bachman says. \u201cI\u2019d like to get access to those.\u201d She also hopes to gain access to archives in Russia and India, though getting permission will be a challenge in both countries.\n\n\u201cThis project has really gotten me excited to share my research with the public in a different way than an academic journal,\u201d says Bachman. \u201cMore than anything, I hope the exhibit broadens people\u2019s perspectives about the Cold War. It is seen as a time when the Soviet Union was isolated from the world, but as the exhibit demonstrates, that was simply not the case.\u201d"},{"title":"Celebrating Persian lives, on stage","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/celebrating-persian-lives-on-stage\/","tags":["arts-sciences","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"UW senior Rhoya Sarikhani Selden\u00a0explored her Persian heritage in a play that celebrates Iranian Americans from diverse backgrounds.","content":"(College of Arts and Sciences, March 2017)\n\nUW senior Rhoya Sarikhani Selden is a mini-United Nations. Her mother emigrated from Iran in the 1970s. Her father\u2019s family has lived in Seattle for more than a century and has British and Lithuanian roots.\u00a0 Her grandparents are Muslim, Jewish, and Mormon. Her stepmother is Peruvian. There are languages spoken in both parents\u2019 homes \u2014 Farsi in her mother\u2019s, Spanish in her father\u2019s \u2014\u00a0that Sarikhani Selden doesn\u2019t speak. \u201cI\u2019m in a no-man\u2019s land,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I have to check the \u2018race\u2019 box on forms, I don\u2019t feel like I belong in any category. But in a way, I can connect to many cultures, which is an advantage.\u201d\n\nSarikhani\u00a0Selden decided to explore her Persian roots in a senior thesis for each of her majors, history and drama. For history, she looked at the politics behind women\u2019s clothing in Tehran at critical moments in the 20th century. For drama she produced a play, <i>A Mosaic of Tehrangeles,<\/i> about the Iranian American experience. The play \u2014 made possible with support from a Mary Gates Leadership Scholarship \u2014 was presented to a sold-out crowd at the UW\u2019s Intellectual House in February 2017.\n\nThe idea for the play grew out of Sarikhani\u00a0Selden\u2019s experience working backstage on a School of Drama production of <i>Arabian Nights<\/i>.\u00a0 She had been excited to work on the show, but was disappointed to find that the production did not accurately represent Middle Eastern culture. \u201cIt was a very Orientalist, romanticized, and eroticized blending of cultures and communities, almost fetishizing them,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI wanted to make a show that represented my culture accurately and authentically.\u201d\n\nSarikhani\u00a0Selden\u2019s play is based on interviews with nearly two dozen Iranian Americans, from teens to grandparents. Some are recent immigrants, others are American-born. Though Sarikhani\u00a0Selden had intended to present a single storyline in the play, the interviews inspired her to change her approach. \u201cThe people I interviewed had so many amazing and different outlooks and experiences,\u201d she says. \u201cI learned so much from their stories \u2014 even about myself \u2014 and realized a single plot wouldn\u2019t capture that.\u201d\n\n<hr \/>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI grew up in a multicultural family and it\u2019s a beautiful thing. ...We don\u2019t need to fear different cultures and different people. Every culture has something to contribute.\n\n<hr \/>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCollaborating with co-writer and co-director Eli Gallagher, a UW sophomore, Sarikhani\u00a0Selden structured the play as a series of vignettes and monologues. \u201cThe spine of the play is about resilience,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about coming together in the face of hardship and overcoming differences, whether that involves dealing with racists or coming out to one\u2019s parents or trying to assimilate in an Islamaphobic culture.\u201d\n\nAll seven cast members are of Persian descent. Three recently emigrated from Iran; two came to the U.S. as refugees. \u201cThe cast is predominantly female, and the female characters play a special role because women are the ones who make sure the culture is passed down to future generations of Iranian Americans,\u201d explains Sarikhani\u00a0Selden. \u201cThey keep our identity alive and our traditions preserved.\u201d\n\nThe play was presented just days after President Trump proposed a ban on immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations including Iran. Interest in the production was so intense that tickets sold out before Sarikhani\u00a0Selden\u00a0even produced posters advertising the play. The venue was reconfigured to accommodate 180 guests, more than double the original estimate.\n\nSarikhani\u00a0Selden was worried about more than logistics during the production. \u201cI was so scared that Iranian people in the audience would say, \u2018No, that\u2019s wrong,\u2019 but I\u2019ve only received positive feedback,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople have told me it was meaningful to them to see their heritage on stage. They cried in parts of the play because it touched them so much. I wasn\u2019t expecting that. It completely made all the stress, all the craziness, worth it.\u201d\n\nSarikhani\u00a0Selden\u2019s history thesis also reflects her heritage and interests. Building on her passion for history and her interest in costume design, she researched the politics behind women\u2019s clothing in Tehran during three distinct periods of the twentieth century. She focused on the 1930s, when traditional Persian clothing was made illegal; the 1960s and 1970s, when fashionable Western clothing was the norm; and the 1980s onward, when Islamic clothing became mandatory, with women completely covered except for their hands and face. \u201cClothing can be very political,\u201d says Sarikhani\u00a0Selden. \u201cIt\u2019s not just what the women wore, but why they wore it or were required to wear it.\u201d Sarikhani\u00a0Selden\u2019s thesis received a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lib.washington.edu\/researchaward\/winners\">Library Research Award for Undergraduates<\/a> from the UW Libraries.\n\nAfter Sarikhani\u00a0Selden graduates in June, she may apply to law school, with a focus on civil rights for Middle Eastern communities. She also may further develop her play, encouraged by audience members who have urged her to continue with the project. Whatever her next step, she is convinced that her diverse background will only be an advantage.\n\n\u201cI grew up in a multicultural family and it\u2019s a beautiful thing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my favorite things about myself. We don\u2019t need to fear different cultures and different people. Every culture has something to contribute.

Their offerings include canvas bags, leather goods and bamboo trekking poles. Each piece is crafted from start to finish in their Fremont workshop.\n\nDan runs Uphill Designs with his partner and Bioengineering alumna, Mallory Monahan (MS \u201915) and with assistance from UW undergraduate Oliver Marczynski. Dan recently sat down with us to talk about their work and how his background in MSE provides the foundation for their products.\n\n<b>COE: Uphill Designs grew out of your experiences hiking the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) and your studies in MSE. Tell us more about these influences.<\/b>\n\nDS: In 2013, I set out to fulfill a life-long dream and hike from Mexico to Canada along the Pacific Crest Trail. After growing up backpacking in Washington, I knew I had to change my approach if I was going to complete the journey, which totaled 2,665 miles. I needed to pack as lightly as possible but I could not find the exact gear I wanted in stores. So I ended up sewing my own backpack and tent.\n\nFrom start to finish, the hike took me 101 days. There was a lot of deprivation on the trail, from 40-mile waterless stretches, to hunger pains, to days without talking to another person, and it gave me time to reflect on the gear on my back compared to all of the things we surround ourselves with in everyday life. I appreciated every piece of equipment as if it were an extension of myself, but the equipment I had made resonated much more than the store-bought pieces. For example, I\u2019d invested in some pricey carbon-fiber trekking poles. Sure, they served their purpose, but I started thinking about how out-of-place they seemed on the trail. Then one day as I was hiking up Mt. Whitney, I encountered a guy on his way down who was just using two bamboo poles with duct tape on the ends as trekking poles \u2014 natural products in a natural environment. And something clicked...\n\n<b>Were you a MSE student at the time?<\/b>\n\nNot yet. I studied physics and English as an undergraduate in California and then worked in an oncology research lab at a Boston hospital. After completing the Pacific Crest Trail, I joined the first class of MSE\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mse.washington.edu\/admission\/graduate\/amp\">Applied Master\u2019s Program<\/a>. When I think about how my life and business have evolved, I\u2019m grateful I earned the master\u2019s degree.\n\nWhen I started at the UW, I had natural and raw materials on my mind. The Applied Master\u2019s Program was flexible enough to allow me to create my own independent study to write up a business plan for my product idea of bamboo trekking poles. That\u2019s when Uphill Designs was born.\n\n<b>How did your MSE background help you develop trekking poles for Uphill Designs?<\/b>\n\nMost trekking poles are made out of aluminum or carbon fiber \u2014 strong, lightweight materials that don\u2019t bend. In the lab I performed \u201cbend tests\u201d on these materials and bamboo. I discovered that bamboo was not only lighter weight than carbon fiber and stronger than aluminum but that some kinds of bamboo will bend back to their original form.\n\n<b>Were there other resources at the UW that helped you develop Uphill Designs as a business?<\/b>\n\nI participated in some of the <a href=\"http:\/\/foster.uw.edu\/centers\/buerk-ctr-entrepreneurship\/\">Buerk Center for Entrepreneurship<\/a>\u2019s competitions. The one that was most beneficial was the <a href=\"http:\/\/foster.uw.edu\/centers\/buerk-ctr-entrepreneurship\/jones-foster-accelerator-program\/\">Jones + Foster Accelerator<\/a>, a structured program that helps early-stage student companies through their first six months. In addition to receiving mentoring, guidance and business plan support, Uphill Designs earned the program\u2019s $25,000 start-up grant.\n\nI also took a class through the Bioengineering department on entrepreneurship and engineering. It focused on aligning engineering skills with business. It\u2019s also where I met my business partner, Mallory.\n\n<b>As you learned more about engineering and business, how did your goals for Uphill Designs change?<\/b>\n\nThe business plan I had originally created shifted dramatically. My goal had been to develop bamboo trekking poles for mass-market audiences, but the more I worked with bamboo, I realized there wasn\u2019t a cost-effective, efficient way to mass-produce the poles since every piece of bamboo is unique. So I started moving toward a much different, smaller scale business approach: I saw us investing in materials and artisanship \u2014 embracing the handmade element of our work.\n\nAfter Mallory joined me at Uphill Designs, we expanded the business to include waxed canvas bags and, most recently, leather bags, wallets and belts. Having two engineers on the team really helps us hone our production process and focus on the right pieces of machinery we need for the future growth.\n\n<b>What\u2019s the single thing you liked best about studying engineering at UW?<\/b>\n\nProfessors like Kannan Krishnan and Jihui Yang in MSE and Matt O\u2019Donnell in BioE \u2013 they set high expectations for students but then shared with us their time and expertise and the resources we needed to excel.\n\nI also valued the MSE program\u2019s flexibility. When I was a student, the department didn\u2019t offer classes in entrepreneurship and engineering, which is why I studied through BioE. But MSE allowed me to do an independent study through which I created Uphill Designs\u2019 business plan. Since graduating, I have kept in touch with the department and provided feedback to help shape an entrepreneurship and commercialization seminar series. Last year I was a guest speaker for the seminar, which was incredibly rewarding.\n\n<b>What\u2019s next for Uphill Designs?<\/b>\n\nWe\u2019re focusing on growth and business sustainability. We want to participate in more Pacific Northwest makers\u2019 markets and get our products into more physical retail shops. Our company thrives on rapid ideation, and we collaborate on custom pieces and continue to fill out our product offering. In the near future, we will open a mixed retail-industrial space where customers can come see our process and find the perfect piece for their adventure. This will also serve as the hub for our growing <a href=\"http:\/\/uphilldesigns.com\/collective\">Uphill Adventures community<\/a>, a group we\u2019ve created and led since 2016 focused on free, monthly trips.\n\nAbove all, we hope to stay strategic and mindful. We believe in our gear, and I\u2019m grateful to be doing something that I\u2019m passionate about. But it\u2019s not easy. To run your own business, you need to be willing to make sacrifices \u2014 to put in 18 hour days when necessary, to work if you\u2019re sick, to live on a shoestring so your business can get by in tough times.

By focusing on creating a solid foundation, the team hopes to set future generations of UW student roboticists on a path to success.\n\nIn August 2012, a NASA rover landed on Mars and immediately went to work collecting and testing soil, rock and atmospheric samples. As its mission unfolded into 2013, Americans began to get to know this robot, fittingly named Curiosity, and, because of its journey, joined scientists in exploring the Red Planet from their televisions, laptops and mobile devices.\n\nThat same year, the UW\u2019s Husky Robotics team decided to build a Mars rover of its own to enter into the <a href=\"http:\/\/urc.marssociety.org\/\">University Rover Challenge<\/a>. Organized by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marssociety.org\/\">Mars Society<\/a>, this competition invites student teams from across the globe to design and build remote-controlled Mars rovers \u2014 space exploration vehicles, like Curiosity, created to explore the surface of a distant planet. The teams then compete their rovers in simulated Mars colony missions at the Mars Society\u2019s desert research station in Hanksville, Utah.\n\nNot only was the UW team new to the competition, they were also relatively new on campus, having only come together the previous year. Evolving from a small group of students who shared an interest in robots and met under the name Dawg Bytes, the team changed its name to Husky Robotics and shifted its focus from working on a handful of small-scale robotics projects to a more formal, singular goal: creating a competition-grade rover.\n\nThe team impressed the judges with one of their early entries: Hydra, a novel treaded tank with pneumatic suspension. Though limited in sensing and controls, Hydra was faster and more powerful than most other rovers in the competition were, and judges commended its unique mechanical design. This encouragement prompted Husky Robotics to deepen and expand its work. Every summer since then, the team has competed rovers \u2014 with an emphasis on mechanically innovative designs \u2014 in the challenge.\n\n<b>Strengthening a multi-disciplinary approach and structure<\/b>\n\n\u201cRobotics is basically the integration of software, hardware and electronics,\u201d says ME graduate student Ben Estroff, who serves this year as Husky Robotics\u2019 public relations lead. \u201cOur team values and practices a multi-disciplinary approach, and our members come from many engineering departments \u2014 ME, CSE, EE and AA, to name a few.\u201d\n\nSince its earliest days, the team has experienced rapid growth. Now with a core membership of about 75 students, team leaders have decided to turn their attention inward.\n\nAccording to Estroff, the team determined it needed a more focused plan for member recruitment and retention, as well as training, skills building and knowledge transfer, so leadership has been working to establish a secure infrastructure for the team. In the last year, they have restructured workflow and written a new constitution to define roles and document policies, procedures and team history. They have adapted project management skills and practices that team members have learned through internships, and they have been working to expand their profile on campus, by participating in events like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.engr.washington.edu\/future\/k12\/discoverydays\">Engineering Discovery Days<\/a> and launching a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.huskyrobotics.me\/\">new website<\/a>. And a few months ago they began working with a new faculty adviser, ME assistant professor Sawyer Fuller.\n\n\u201cI've long been very excited about the mission of the Mars Society, human exploration and colonization of Mars, and I'm hoping that my research in robotics will be able to contribute to this area in the future,\u201d Fuller says. \u201cSince the team is involved with two things I\u2019m really excited about \u2014 robotics and Mars exploration \u2014 how could I say no when asked to serve as their new adviser?\u201d\n\nFuller, who researches in the areas of insectoid robotics and biologically-inspired sensors, controls and design, hopes to help the team by providing stability and perspective. He says that he is looking forward to seeing the solutions the team comes up with for the technical challenges of this year\u2019s Mars Society Challenge.\n\n<b>New directions: Machining and more<\/b>\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles the team has had to overcome is access to workshop space and machine training. Since team members rely heavily on the equipment in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.me.washington.edu\/instructional_shops\/machine\">ME\u2019s Machine Shop<\/a>, Husky Robotics leads have worked closely with the Shop\u2019s managers to create two team shopmaster positions. With extra training, these students can instruct and supervise other students on machine use and safety.\n\nME senior Ashley Combs serves as one of this year\u2019s shopmasters and well as Husky Robotics\u2019 chassis lead. \u201cI had some experience working with hand tools, and I\u2019d worked on cars with my dad, but I\u2019d never experienced anything like the Machine Shop before joining Husky Robotics,\u201d she says. \u201cMachining is one of my favorite challenges \u2014 it\u2019s where your design ideas are tested and actualized, and knowledge of materials and structures is a must.\u201d\n\nServing as the team\u2019s lead machinist and shopmaster has allowed her to expand her understanding of what is physically capable of being machined, not to mention her communications and teaching skills. She believes these experiences will translate directly to the work she wants to do after graduation.\n\n\u201cI hope to get a job in robotics and systems integration after I graduate,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m interested in the \u2018full picture\u2019 of an engineering system \u2014 how everything works together \u2014 from design to planning to prototype development and assembly.\u201d\n\nIn ME, Combs is studying mechatronics and robotics, and because of her research background, team responsibilities and experience gained from a summer internship at The Boeing Company, she says she feels excited and prepared to enter the job market.\n\nBoth Combs and Estroff know that Husky Robotics still has plenty of work ahead in terms of refining team structure, workflow and administration. They are also quick to acknowledge that there are still significant opportunities for growth in areas such as diversification and fundraising for construction and travel to the competition in Utah. But they are pleased with the progress the team has made this year.\n\n\u201cBeing a part of Husky Robotics provides students opportunities to collaborate with engineers across disciplines, and practice team-building, communications and project management, in addition to honing technical skills,\u201d Estroff explains. \u201cWe believe in the value of this student club, and while we know we can\u2019t tackle everything at once, we want to do what we can to ensure it stays around a long time.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s still this summer\u2019s challenge to look forward to. Approximately 80 teams applied for the 2017 University Rover Challenge, and Husky Robotics is one of the 30 that has been invited to participate in the competition. With a new design and approach this year, the team hopes to make another lasting impression on the judges."},{"title":"A formula for success","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/a-formula-for-success\/","tags":["engineering","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"For 28 years, UW Formula Motorsports has brought together students to design, build and compete formula-style vehicles.

Team members credit their culture of student leadership and mentorship as key to the team\u2019s stability and success.\n\nIt\u2019s 4:00 a.m. on the Friday before fall finals week and ME senior Lexi Overstreet is heading to campus. A member of the <a href=\"https:\/\/uwformula.com\/\">UW Formula Motorsports<\/a> student club (FSAE), she hopes to arrive at the team\u2019s workspace \u2014 known as the \u201cpit\u201d \u2014 before any of her teammates so she can set up holiday decorations and surprise everyone with presents. She reaches the pit to find the lights on, a few teammates already inside working on plans and parts. She is not surprised.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what time of day or night you stop by the pit, you\u2019ll always find people here,\u201d she says. \u201cThis place has become our home away from home.\u201d\n\nFSAE comprises about 80 students from across the College of Engineering and other disciplines. Every year they design and build small, formula style vehicles from scratch to compete against other university teams in challenges organized by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sae.org\/\">SAE International<\/a>. Competition judges assess their vehicles on a variety of criteria, ranging from \u201cstatic\u201d elements (soundness of design and manufacturing costs) to \u201cdynamic\u201d performance (endurance, skidpad, acceleration and autocross racing).\n\nFor this year\u2019s competitions, UW FSAE hopes to compete two vehicles: one combustion and the other electric. The club spent autumn quarter steeped in design mode, and now team members are beginning to create parts for their vehicles. They spend most of winter quarter building and assembling their vehicles so they can focus on testing and refinement in the spring.\n\nFor Overstreet, FSAE has been an integral part of her Husky experience. \u201cGrowing up, I loved building things, and I was curious about cars but had never had the chance to work on them,\u201d she says. Eager for the hands-on opportunities and challenges that FSAE promised, she joined the club on the second day of her first year at the UW.\n\nShe now serves as one of the team\u2019s leads, overseeing FSAE business and suspension performance (all students must serve on both an administrative and technical team). She is responsible for training and supervising five students. \u201cI love being in a position to help guide the club and other students,\u201d she says. \u201cTeam mentoring is one of the best things about FSAE.\u201d\n\n<b>A culture of mentorship<\/b>\n\nAndrei Arevalo can attest to the value of team mentorship. Like Overstreet, he joined FSAE his first year as an undergraduate. Now an ME graduate student, he is the team\u2019s Teaching Assistant and is responsible for assessing student performance. He also serves as a liaison between the club, its faculty adviser and the ME department.\n\nArevalo first learned about FSAE at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.engr.washington.edu\/future\/k12\/discoverydays\">Engineering Discovery Days<\/a>, which he attended in high school. \u201cI\u2019d had zero experience with cars, or even tools for that matter, but the vehicles just looked so cool,\u201d he says. He applied for the club as soon as he was accepted to the UW.\n\nNow in its 28th year, FSAE is a registered student organization, housed in the ME department. Participating ME students may earn credit in upper-level engineering classes.\n\n\u201cOur team\u2019s longtime adviser, ME professor Ashley Emery, is encouraging and supportive but very hands-off, and that\u2019s created the culture of student mentorship we have today,\u201d Arevalo explains. \u201cAll of the club\u2019s efforts are student-led and executed: design, building, testing and driving, but also budget management, sponsorship solicitation, public relations and travel planning.\u201d\n\nThe team\u2019s overarching goal, he says, is to produce well-rounded engineers, so the club operates using a formal structure that mimics workflow commonly found in industry: three student directors oversee administrative and technical student leads, who teach and supervise the students on their subteams. Team members rely heavily on the equipment in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.me.washington.edu\/instructional_shops\/machine\">ME\u2019s Machine Shop<\/a>; with extra training, students may serve as shopmasters and instruct and supervise other students on machine use and safety.\n\n\u201cEvery year, teammates graduate, so to ensure the long-term success of the club, it\u2019s important to invest in knowledge-transferring,\u201d Arevalo says. \u201cIf one of us fails, then we all fail, so we work really hard to help everyone succeed.\u201d\n\n<b>\u201cME and the club go hand-in-hand\u201d<\/b>\n\n\u201cI\u2019m lucky to have found a way to align my passion with my degree,\u201d says ME junior Nick D\u2019Alo. \u201cME and the club go hand-in-hand, and I can\u2019t imagine one without the other.\u201d D\u2019Alo, who says that he was obsessed with cars as a kid, joined FSAE with some basic car maintenance experience, though he\u2019s quick to add that \u201cit was nothing nearly as intensive or creative as what we do in the pit.\u201d\n\nFor him, FSAE provides the space to apply what he\u2019s learning in his engineering classes about design and manufacturing. \u201cSometimes you can only go so far in a classroom,\u201d he says. \u201cFortunately, we have all sorts of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.engr.washington.edu\/current\/studentprogs\/orgs\">engineering student clubs<\/a> where we can practice what we\u2019re learning about \u2014 FSAE, Hyperloop, Robotics, Engineers Without Borders, WOOF3-D, just to name a few.\u201d\n\nOverstreet agrees. For her to grasp something, she says, she needs to experience it. In this way, time with the club and in the Machine Shop have been invaluable. Plus, she adds, there\u2019s another incentive to being a part of FSAE: the teammates.\n\n\u201cThe club is my family,\u201d she says. \u201cMy teammates are my classmates and friends, but also my teachers and mentors.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Alo cites the friendships he\u2019s made with his teammates as one of the best things about the club. \u201cWe have a saying: \u2018You come for the cars, but you stay for the people,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cIt might sound silly, but it\u2019s true \u2014 we work on this amazing project together, we take most of our classes together, we graduate and then enter the job market together.\u201d\n\nThe bond extends past graduation. Former FSAE members often stay in touch with the club and share their experiences of entering the workforce. Some team members go on to work at places such as Blue Origin, Tesla and SpaceX, and many more accept positions at Boeing and other local companies. Over the years, many of these companies have also become team sponsors, helping to cover the costs of parts, manufacturing, registration fees and travel to competitions.\n\nThis support will be very important next year, as the team transitions to focusing their efforts solely on their electric car. \u201cFor many years, we\u2019ve been leaders in the competition with our combustion car, but we really need to develop our skills in electric car technology,\u201d Arevalo explains. \u201cThe automotive industry is growing in this direction, so it\u2019s important that we do the same.\u201d\n\nHe also cites the industry\u2019s expansion into the arena of driverless cars \u2014 a new area of the SAE International competition as well. UW FSAE hopes to tackle this challenge in the future but acknowledges that doing so will take many additional resources: time, students, expertise and funds.\n\nFor now, the team has this summer\u2019s competitions to focus on. Most members agree that competition season is the highlight of the year.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s stateside or international competition, I love seeing our vehicles lined up next to those from other schools and knowing all of the parts that are inside,\u201d says Overstreet. \u201cI especially love being able to point to a part \u2014 particularly the more complicated parts \u2014 and saying, I made that.\u201d\n\nFor Arevalo, while FSAE has allowed him to hone technical engineering skills, he is most proud of the work ethic and leadership skills he has developed as the team\u2019s TA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to translating these skills into my first engineering job after I finish my degree,\u201d he says.\n\nFSAE will be competing regionally this June at <a href=\"http:\/\/students.sae.org\/cds\/formulaseries\/west\/\">Formula SAE West<\/a> in Lincoln, Nebraska, and internationally in August at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.formulastudent.de\/\">Formula Student Germany<\/a>.

KiloWatts for Humanity has established solar- and wind-powered energy kiosks to provide electricity to communities that are not connected to the national grid.","content":"(College of Engineering, February 2017)\n\nIn Kitwe, Zambia a raw wilderness meets industrial potential. Fruit stands are propped up on top of burning sands. Women tend to the tropical fruit, an array of incandescent color, boldly mirrored in their intricate headresses.\n\nIn town, tall 1960s-style highrises flank city streets, cars\u00a0 thrum\u00a0 through choked intersections\u00a0 and weave around endless passersby.\n\nAs the second largest city in the nation, Kitwe sets the foundation for economic and industrial development. However, urban potential and actual economic growth and development\u00a0 are not synonymous systems in Zambia.\n\nLess than three percent of rural Zambians live with electricity. For rural communities, power runs like a golden thread through the houses of the lucky. Even in urban cities, like Kitwe, less than 20 percent of people have electricity.\n\nThe country\u2019s high reliance on hydropower and confined power distribution infrastructure has left the nation with a limited source and lacking structure. Because of the high demand for power, the unstable power grid suffers from constant blackouts.\n\nThe Zambian government has put forth new initiatives to preserve power and prevent blackouts. In July 2015, Zambian officials began a load-shedding program. It delivers power on a rolling schedule, offering electricity\u00a0 to different areas at planned times.\n\nIt was around the same time the load-shedding\u00a0 program began when Henry Louie (PhD \u201808), an electrical engineering alum and assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering\u00a0at Seattle University, arrived in Zambia. Louie received a Fulbright Award, allowing him to spend a year at Copperbelt University in Kitwe, Zambia. During this year, Louie not only taught courses on power engineering at the university, but he also traveled to remote villages around several African nations to implement power systems.\n\nWhile in Zambia, Louie\u00a0 worked with KiloWatts for Humanity, a non-profit organization that he co-founded in 2009.\n\n\u201cI worked with KiloWatts for Humanity to establish two solar-powered \u2018energy kiosks\u2019 that provide electricity to communities that are not connected to the grid,\u201d Louie said. \u201cHundreds of people in these villages now have access to electric lights (important for safety and to allow children to study at night), refrigeration and radios\/TVs.\u201d\n\nThese \u201cenergy kiosks\u201d or microgrids can supply electricity to a large group of individuals through solar and wind power. In Zambia, most communities do not have access to a broad national grid network. Louie and his team analyzed the conditions of the villages they visited. Then they raised the grant money they needed to install microgrids.\n\nLouie has always had an interest in tackling energy poverty. As a Ph.D. student at the UW, Louie worked on renewable energy forecasting, power system optimization and electricity markets. After visiting Zambia for the first time in 2009, he realized he wanted to return for a longer period of time to really evaluate the current energy situation. The Fulbright allowed him to do just that.\n\nAt Copperbelt University, Louie\u2019s research evaluated the effectiveness of load-shedding in conserving energy, as well as its impact on people and the environment.\n\n\u201cWhile in Zambia, I established a research group at Copperbelt University,\u201d Louie said. \u201cWe are studying the effects of the on-going electricity shortage in Zambia. Every day we are subjected to 8 hours without electricity\u2026This work is on-going, and I will continue the collaboration with my Zambian colleagues while back at Seattle University.\u201d\n\nLouie worked with Zambia\u2019s largest\u00a0 power company, ZESCO, to develop models of their rural distribution networks. In addition, he utilized the company\u2019s hard data. He compared these results to earlier survey results.\u00a0 Louie and his team surveyed over 200 households in Copperbelt connected to the power grid.\n\n\u201cWithout electricity, people are switching to other energy sources like charcoal, which is expensive and can lead to negative environmental outcomes like forest degradation and CO2 emissions,\u201d Louie said.\n\nLouie hopes that the results from the survey can galvanize the international community to financially support the implementation of more microgrids and the generation of more power for the nation.\n\nIn the United States, energy availability is so prevalent that it is ignored as a luxury. As energy became more commonplace, the U.S. witnessed an increase in industrial and agricultural gains. Additionally, education levels improved with access to light to read and, eventually, the connectivity of computer machines.\n\nZambia, as well as other African nations like Ethiopia and Liberia, is investing in initiatives to improve quality of life and advance its country to compete on the world stage. Microgrids and similar energy sources offer the clean, inexpensive power access that is needed for economic, societal and environmental development.\n\nLouie will continue to be a strong advocate for energy access, dedicating his life\u2019s work\u00a0 to improving energy poverty around the world.\n\n\u201cIn the short-term, I\u2019m especially enjoying having 24-hour access to electricity, internet and clean water,\u201d Louie said. \u201cIn the longer-term, my colleagues at Seattle University and at KiloWatts for Humanity will continue to establish energy kiosks in energy-impoverished areas.\u201d"},{"title":"Feasting with a forager","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/feasting-with-a-forager\/","tags":["alumni","arts-sciences"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Langdon Cook (MFA, 1994) is an expert on the pleasures of foraging for food.","content":"(College of Arts and Sciences, January 2017)\n\nMost people return from a mountain hike or beach walk with an appreciation for nature. Langdon Cook returns with ingredients for dinner.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCook (MFA, Creative Writing, 1994) is an author and experienced forager who has written books on foraging and offers talks and workshops on the topic. \u201cWe\u2019ve become so disconnected from our landscape,\u201d he says. \u201cForaging is a way to get back in touch with what supports us. It\u2019s a great way to introduce people to the outdoors and have them become lifelong stewards.\u201d\n\nThough Cook was always interested in the natural world, he didn\u2019t discover foraging until he moved to the Northwest to pursue a <a href=\"https:\/\/english.washington.edu\/creative-writing-program\">masters in creative writing<\/a> at the UW. He previously worked as a newspaper reporter and copy editor in the San Francisco Bay area. \u201cThe MFA program seemed like a way I could really dig down into the craft of writing,\u201d Cook says.\n\nWhile at the UW, Cook began exploring wilderness areas, often with friends from the Department of English. They fished the Yakima Canyon, foraged in the Pasayten Wilderness, and harvested clams and oysters on Puget Sound beaches. They even took up squid jigging. \u201cWe were broke graduate students,\u201d Cook\u00a0says, \u201cbut we\u2019d have these great parties with gourmet foods we\u2019d gathered around Puget Sound.\u201d\n\nIn all my writing, what I\u2019m really interested in is the human element. I\u2019m intrigued by this crossroads where nature, food, and people intersect.\n\nCook\u2019s focus on living off the land intensified during a nine-month stay in a remote homestead in Oregon\u2019s Rogue River Canyon. By then he\u2019d earned his MFA, spent seven years as an editor at Amazon, married, and had a son. The homestead experience came by way of his wife, poet Martha\u00a0Silano\u00a0(MFA, Creative Writing, 1993), who received a residency that included caretaking the remote property. \u201cNeither of us expected to live in a city so long, so this residency seemed a good way to get away from all that,\u201d says Cook. \u201cIt was an opportunity to get our three-year-old son into the woods and pass along some of the values we considered important.\u201d\n\nThe homestead was two hours from the nearest town by way of a rough logging road. For a steady supply of fresh food, the family foraged regularly in the thousands of acres of wilderness that surrounded them. Cook also got back to writing, which had taken a back seat during his years at Amazon.\n\n\u201cI kept a blog\u2014this was in the very early stages of blogging\u2014with photos and little stories about what we were up to, mostly to let our friends and family know that we were okay,\u201d Cook says. He uploaded the blog at a coffee shop whenever he made the trek into town for groceries.\n\nAfter returning to Seattle, Cook shaped the blog posts into personal essays. He noticed that many had foraging as a common theme. He also wrote about other foraging adventures, including some during his UW years. The collection of essays became his first book, <i>Fat of the Land: Adventures of a 21<\/i><i>st<\/i><i> Century Forager<\/i>.\n\nThe book is not a \u201chow to\u201d manual for foraging;\u00a0it is a memoir infused with a passion for storytelling. \u201cI realized I could use fictional devices in my nonfiction to make it really jump off the page,\u201d Cook says. \u201cThe essays are more like stories with great characters.\u201d The book also includes recipes for making the most of foraged ingredients like stinging nettles, fiddlehead ferns, morel mushrooms, and razor clams.\n\nFor his second book, which won a 2014 Pacific Northwest Book Award, Cook researched a different aspect of foraging--the colorful lives of West Coast mushroom pickers and buyers. <i>The Mushroom Hunters: On the Trail of an Underground America<\/i> explores a world that is little known despite being a multi-million dollar industry. Cook\u2019s third book, scheduled for publication in 2017, focuses on wild salmon and features a large cast of characters, from scientists and fisherman to environmental activists and chefs. \u201cIn all my writing, what I\u2019m really interested in is the human element,\u201d says Cook. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m intrigued by this crossroads where nature, food, and people intersect. And I like to tell a good story.\u201d\n\nWhen he\u2019s not writing, Cook offers talks and workshops on foraging. (See <a href=\"http:\/\/langdoncook.com\/\">langdoncook.com<\/a>.) He finds that many people fear foraged foods, worried they might mistake a poisonous plant for a benign one. \u201cThat fear is not misplaced,\u201d Cook says. \u201cYou have to learn. And there\u2019s no better way than by going out with someone knowledgeable to see plants and mushrooms firsthand, in their habitat. Photos or illustrations in a book don\u2019t tell the whole story.\u201d\n\nCook will often take people to Seattle\u2019s Seward Park to point out what\u2019s edible, though he\u2019s quick to note that foraging is illegal in city parks. For those willing to learn, he believes the rewards are tremendous, adding that some of his favorite memories have involved foraging with friends and cooking a feast with the bounty.\n\n\u201cYou come home from the woods or the beach tired, sweaty, and muddy, and someone opens a bottle of wine and everybody starts cooking together,\u201d he says. \u201cI love how communal the experience can be. It\u2019s just a great exclamation point after a day of foraging.\u201d"},{"title":"Finding purpose in Peru","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/finding-purpose-in-peru\/","tags":["alumni","arts-sciences"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"Celeste Marion (BA, 2003) co-founded an innovative school for special education students in Cusco, Peru.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, January 2017)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Two months.

Later, as a UW student, she completed a psychology practicum at the UW\u2019s Experimental Education Unit, working with infants and toddlers on the autism spectrum. That added up to considerably more experience than any of the teachers she assisted in Peru\u2014which is why the school asked her to stay on to train its teachers after her volunteer stint ended.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI thought a one-year contract in a foreign country would look great on grad school applications,\u201d Marion recalled thinking at the time.\u00a0 That reasoning proved true when she applied and was accepted to the UW\u2019s graduate program in special education. But she hadn\u2019t figured on caring so deeply about her Peruvian students. Over the next few years, she deferred graduate school twice to stay in Peru.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">We wanted to teach kids to have a quality of life, and we wanted to prove to parents that their children could learn.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">During that time, Marion befriended Mercedes Delgado, a teacher who worked at a state-run special education school in Cusco. \u201cMercedes had a really different outlook [than many Peruvians] on what she thought this population deserved,\u201d Marion says, explaining that Peru is decades behind the U.S. in its views toward people with disabilities. \u201cShe and I would brainstorm about how we would do things differently if we had the chance.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Taking baby steps, the two women started an afterschool program with two special needs students. (Marion taught at a bilingual kindergarten during the day.) More students came on board through word of mouth, growing the program to a dozen students within a year. But with no financial resources and few families able to pay, the program was not sustainable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>A student rides a bicycle in the courtyard at Camino Nuevo, the school founded by Celeste Marion and Peruvian colleague\u00a0Mercedes Delgado.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe came to the realization that this was not going to be a for-profit business,\u201d says Marion. \u201cBut we wanted to teach kids to have a quality of life, and we wanted to prove to parents that their children could learn. Our mission was to serve all parents, regardless of ability to pay.\u201d Marion and Delgado successfully obtained nonprofit status and Manos Unidas was born.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The program continued to expand, outgrowing its tight quarters. At the same time, parents expressed an interest in a school rather than just an afterschool program. Marion came back to the U.S. to raise funds, and in 2009 she and Delgado opened Camino Nuevo, a school for children with disabilities in Cusco. The school began with thirty students and a six-member staff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite all she\u2019d accomplished in Peru, Marion still intended to return to the U.S. to continue her education. But a year after launching Camino Nuevo, she had what she describes as an awakening. \u201cThe school was just a year old and I was fearful that if I left, it would all collapse, all the work we\u2019d put into it,\u201d she recalls. \u201cMercedes was still working for the public school\u2014she couldn\u2019t risk her 22 years there and her retirement for this school that might or might not work out. So I ended up surrendering and saying, \u2018Okay God, if this is where you want me, I accept it. I\u2019m going to stop trying to move back to the United States.\u2019\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Marion believes that was a turning point for Manos Unidas. She did visit the U.S. soon after\u2014but all in service to the school. Friends and acquaintances across the country organized gatherings so she could spread the word and raise funds. On U.S. college campuses, she posted opportunities for volunteers. (UW students studying in Cusco have been among the volunteers.)\u00a0 Marion also met with specialists in everything from special education to marketing to curriculum development. \u201cI generated a group of advisers that I could go to as mentors,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of them are still in my network to this day.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Manos Unidas now serves 75 students, with a staff of 32 and two boards\u2014one in Peru, one in the U.S. (Manos Unidas International was created as a U.S. nonprofit in 2014.) In addition to Camino Nuevo, MU now offers an inclusive education program through which 25 students attend public school in Cusco with an MU teacher frequently on site.\u00a0 When students age out of these options, Manos Unidas offers a life-skills program that covers basic skills like how to shop, take the bus, and cook. In the past year, MU added Phawarispa, a vocational training program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe vocational training program is very exciting,\u201d says Marion. \u201cThis is where students discover what they are capable of and how they are going to formally integrate into society. Some students are able to work independently with partial support; others need a lot of support.\u201d Even students with severe and profound disabilities participate through an on-site work program at MU.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Marion has still more ideas. She recently worked with her two boards on a five-year \u201cdream plan,\u201d which includes creating an on-site preschool that brings together regular and special education students.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ve gained a lot of tools and feel confident in what I\u2019m doing now,\u201d Marion says. \u201cIt\u2019s fun. My brain is always going a gazillion miles an hour.\u201d<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Opening the door to opportunity","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/opening-the-door-to-opportunity\/","tags":["college-of-education","engineering","graduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"As an instructor and student member of the UW's Race &amp; Equity Initiative steering committee, Ph.D. candidate Gonzalo Guzman is tackling justice from K\u201312 to college.","content":"(UW homepage, December 2016)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When Gonzalo Guzman was a young boy in Wapato, Washington, scientists, technologists, engineers and mathematicians of color would stand proudly at the front of his classroom and proclaim to the students that they, too, could have a future as a chemist or a coder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It was encouraging, says Guzman, but in some ways, limiting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cHigher education was pretty much only promoted as a STEM endeavor,\u201d he says. \u201cI never had a historian or a sociologist \u2014 or anyone from the humanities who was of color \u2014 come to my school and say \u2018Hey, you can do this.\u2019\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">For Guzman, there was a divide; a prescribed path for him based on the color of his skin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">So when he came to the UW as an engineering major and realized STEM wasn\u2019t the only pipeline for him, he knew he had to make sure that young students of color everywhere knew they could be whatever they wanted to be, too. He worked toward his bachelors in history and Latin American studies at the UW, and, inspired by his teachers and the McNair Program, went on to earn a masters of education in social and cultural foundations. Now, he\u2019s working toward his Ph.D. in the same field, focusing on equity and opportunity in schools.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">As a student member of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/raceequity\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Race &amp; Equity Initiative Steering Committee<\/span><\/a>, he listens to the concerns on campus when it comes to making the UW a more diverse and equitable place. As an instructor, he\u2019s partnering with the Pipeline Project to address those concerns far before college-aged years through a mixed-enrollment seminar called \u201cRace, Racism &amp; Child Development.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Issues of racism and equity are happening all around us, and the University is making a commitment and saying these issues are important. That alone opens up a platform for students, faculty and staff to enter that space and speak up. As part of the Race &amp; Equity Initiative Steering Committee, I want to make sure the UW sets an example. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The course was inspired by Guzman\u2019s wife and fellow alum, Danielle, through the detracking efforts she and her co-teacher spearheaded at Leschi Elementary School in Seattle\u2019s Central District. Detracking happens when students are intentionally placed into mixed-ability classrooms, as opposed to classrooms based on academic standing or ability \u2014 a move that\u2019s typically reserved for secondary education.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Leschi housed two classroom tracks: contemporary and Montessori. \u201cContemporary was where you had all the special education students, all the bilingual students, most of the immigrant students, and the free and reduced lunch students \u2014 and most of these students were of color, particularly black and Latino,\u201d says Guzman. \u201cMontessori was the opposite. It was a contrasting mirror of affluent students, mostly white. You\u2019d walk down the hallway and one classroom would be students of color, and the other would be white. Even the curriculum was different.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The divide was glaringly obvious, and the segregation, though unintentional, was a problem that needed to be addressed immediately. So Danielle \u2014 who taught contemporary \u2014 and a Montessori teacher, did something about it: they integrated their classrooms as part of a pilot program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt worked,\u201d says Guzman. A year later, the entire school adopted the model. The curricula were integrated, the students were integrated, and as a result, both contemporary and Montessori had lost their once-segregated identities \u2014 but that didn\u2019t necessarily mean the culture had completely changed. That\u2019s when Guzman came in. \u201cThere needed to be a true cultural integration, where teachers and community members were all working together to make sure this school is actually changing and evolving in deeper ways,\u201d he says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">And so the UW\u2019s \u201cRace, Racism &amp; Child Development\u201d seminar was born. In Guzman\u2019s course, co-taught by Danielle, practitioners from Leschi \u2014 from teachers to social workers to leadership \u2014 pair with undergraduates to talk honestly about the real issues at hand. And the movement\u2019s only growing, from PTA-hosted forums in the Central District to expanded seminar offerings on campus and at Leschi.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe\u2019re building off the equity work the community was doing, but we\u2019re also building off my expertise in racial work and education from a larger historical level,\u201d says Guzman. \u201cFor me, progress in education looks like teachers at Leschi utilizing the work they do with us in practice at the UW \u2014 actually changing the curriculum and implementing activities and assignments where issues of the students\u2019 race is coming through as opposed to just talking about it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Painting by numbers: Engineering, art and data science","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/painting-by-numbers-engineering-art-and-data-science\/","tags":["alumni","arts-sciences","engineering"],"pillars":[""],"image":"","excerpt":"Alumna Susie Lu's unique double major in Painting and Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering set her on a career path to data visualization.","content":"(College of Engineering, February 2017)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Painting and industrial engineering may seem like an unlikely pairing for an undergraduate double-major. But for Shan \u201cSusie\u201d Lu (\u201910), both courses of study were essential; for her, picking between them was not an option, as both inspired and challenged her in different but compelling ways. So, she decided to pursue her B.S. in engineering and B.F.A. in art simultaneously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Since then, she\u2019s woven skills gained from both into a rich career in data visualization. Currently a Senior Data Visualization Engineer at Netflix, Susie recently spoke with us about how she uses her experience in art and engineering to bring a well-rounded perspective to data science.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>COE: Tell us about working in the field of data visualization. What does a data visualization engineer do?<\/b>\nSL: Data visualization engineers present trends, figures, statistics, stories, correlations and so on, in a visual context so that it can be better understood and assessed. These days, companies tend to be very interested in gathering as much data as possible. That\u2019s great, but to make it useful, they need ways to analyze it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At Netflix, we do a lot of A\/B testing and data analysis to better understand our audiences. I spend time programming custom data visualization applications in which I present analytics in a graphical format to help Netflix effectively understand our data. This has the potential to inform many aspects of Netflix\u2019s business \u2014 from how users interface with the Netflix app, to which movies are offered through it, to the types of shows Netflix produces.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How did you get interested in data visualization?<\/b>\nAfter graduating from the UW, I worked at Accenture Technology Labs. I learned how to program on the job and became a front-end developer. I grew interested in visual storytelling and how we could design and build websites and platforms that told stories based on insights gained from data. For example, I developed a visual story that <a href=\"http:\/\/susielu.com\/data-viz\/hotshot-charts\"><span class=\"s2\">examined NBA teams by assists and each player's shot record<\/span><\/a>. My time at Accenture provided my first dip into data visualization and I enjoyed the challenge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">From there I worked as a data scientist and data visualization developer for Silicon Valley Data Science, where I created visual stories for clients and internal audiences. A few examples include <a href=\"http:\/\/www.svds.com\/rockandroll\"><span class=\"s2\">The History of Rock &amp; Roll in 100 Songs<\/span><\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.svds.com\/gerrymandering\"><span class=\"s2\">The State of Gerrymandering<\/span><\/a>. And then I was hired at Netflix.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I didn\u2019t intend to have a career in data visualization when I was in school; in fact, the field was really just forming then. But I\u2019m glad to be here; it\u2019s been a great space for me to draw from both my art and engineering backgrounds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>While at the UW, you double-majored in ISE and Painting. Why?<\/b>\nI had always been interested in math and science but knew I wanted to do work that was more applied than research-based. I was drawn to ISE because I liked the way it integrated information, business and people (among other things) to design and improve systems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But I also loved painting, and I couldn\u2019t help but enroll in art classes at the UW. Art became very important to me, and after a few years, I\u2019d taken enough art classes to be well on my way to a major. At first I thought I was crazy to consider double-majoring in two very different programs, but my mom encouraged me. I needed to make art, just like I needed to flex the engineering muscles in my brain. My mom saw this in me and gave me advice that I still carry with me today: She told me that I didn\u2019t have to excel at everything but that I should focus on what I cared most about. If I cared about both painting and engineering, she said, then I should pursue both.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>To a lot of readers, these two programs probably seem like very different worlds. Were they?<\/b>\nIn many ways, yes! There was no overlap in the curriculum, and both had very different requirements for senior projects and graduation. But for me, they presented a balance of intellectual activity and curiosity. I became good at prioritizing projects and managing my time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For me, art and engineering became complements to each other; when I\u2019d start to feel really uncreative or burnt-out with painting, then I could throw myself into my engineering projects. Likewise, when I needed a break from engineering, I had my art. The correspondent nature of their relationship still drives me today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What did you like best about your time at the UW?<\/b>\nOne of the best moments was at graduation when professors from both the ISE and Art Departments nominated me for Dean\u2019s Medals, and I received one from each college. I also had the opportunity to study art history in Italy through the Art Department \u2014 I\u2019ll never forget that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition to these experiences, so many of the skills I learned through ISE have been essential. For example, learning to work collaboratively was a huge part of what I gained from ISE. I was the president of the student group in my senior year. That was such an enjoyable experience because all of the officers took their roles seriously and I was able to delegate, rely on them and give them freedom and responsibility for their jobs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Are there any engineering classes that have been particularly helpful?<\/b>\nThe human factors class I took in ISE has been very helpful. Since I\u2019m building applications, I often apply the design principles from that class to understand my audience and create thoughtful, easy-to-use applications. All of the statistics, modeling, simulation and design of experiments classes have also really paid off. Many of the dashboards I work on use statistics to calculate if changes in the data we are seeing is significant. Having had the exposure to all of these concepts has made conversations with the users of these applications much easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What advice do you have for current students?<\/b>\nFocus on your strengths, and do what motivates you. Find what you really care about and become exceptional at it. For me art and engineering are both integral to who I am, and for a time I struggled with feeling like I had to pick one or the other. Once I realized that I couldn\u2019t choose between them, and instead chose to pursue both, I felt much more motivated. And complete. Yes, it meant more work, but it was work I cared about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Learn more about UW\u2019s undergraduate programs in <a href=\"http:\/\/ise.washington.edu\/admissions\/BSIE\"><span class=\"s2\">ISE<\/span><\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/art.washington.edu\/art\/painting-drawing\"><span class=\"s2\">Painting + Drawing<\/span><\/a>, and see more of Susie\u2019s art and data visualization projects at <a href=\"http:\/\/susielu.com\/\"><span class=\"s2\">susielu.com<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Bridging the \"know-do\" gap","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/bridging-the-know-do-gap\/","tags":["alumni","faculty","giving","graduate-student","school-of-medicine","public-health"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"Home to the world's first Ph.D. program in implementation science, the School of Public Health's DeWorm3 project is turning research into action to interrupt the transmission of parasitic worms in developing countries.","content":"(UW homepage, February 2017)\n\nAnemia.

As a Peace Corps volunteer, she was stationed in rural Zambia, working on community-led malaria prevention campaigns and HIV testing and treatments. \u201cThere\u2019s no substitute for that level of real world experience,\u201d says the Atlanta native. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to study diseases related to poverty, but it\u2019s another to live with people who have been subject to it for years.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">And it\u2019s another thing altogether to solve issues surrounding disease and poverty \u2014 two public health, human rights issues that often pose a chicken-and-egg problem: in the case of soil-transmitted helminths, poverty gives rise to worms; worms reinforce poverty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">These worms are all over the world, but in countries like Japan and the United States, public health officials have been able to control or even disrupt the transmission of the disease as the nations develop economically. In impoverished areas of Africa and Asia, they're still battling the cycle. So what are the barriers to eradicating this malady on a global scale?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">The primary culprits are limited access to clean water and sanitation resources, and the fact that in current deworming programs, only preschool- and school-aged children are receiving treatment, says Means.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">Worm infections come from eating unwashed fruits and vegetables that have a trace of fecal matter. They come from drinking contaminated water, or from simply walking barefoot \u2014 some worms migrate through the skin. Because only children are being treated, a child could be rid of his or her infection one day, then go back to their earthen-floor home and get re-infected the next. \u201cUnless you can get this really intense community-wide treatment going, disrupting the transmission is pretty challenging,\u201d says Means.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">And therein lies the solution to break the cycle: programs that treat everyone, in all households, more than once a year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Mass drug administration programs have targeted entire communities before, and the strategy works. A large-scale effort to squash another parasitic disease, lymphatic filariasis (commonly known as elephantiasis), kicked off in 2000. Community-wide treatment helped transmission rates drop 43 percent in just 15 years. More than 800 million people have been treated so far, and in some countries, the transmission cycle has been interrupted. By 2020, the hope is for lymphatic filariasis to be eliminated completely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">There's an opportunity here, says Means, to leverage the existing treatment platforms already in place in Benin, Malawi and India for DeWorm3\u2019s efforts. In fact, both lymphatic filariasis and intestinal worm treatments co-share a drug: albendazole.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This is what implementation science is all about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Starting in 2017, at the end of the lymphatic filariasis programs in these countries, DeWorm3 will randomly assign communities to either maintain the standard program of only treating preschool- and school-aged children for intestinal worms, or go to a highly intensive treatment plan where they treat everyone in the community twice per year. And they will conduct further implementation science research activities along the way to understand best practices in intervention delivery and opportunities to maximize community participation. In 2020, both types of communities will stop all treatment. Two years later, DeWorm3 will compare the groups and determine whether the intensified treatment program was more successful. If so, they\u2019ll work with policymakers to develop relevant guidelines that could be used to bring the intensified intervention to scale.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Collaboration is the key to it all, says Means, who plans to continue working with DeWorm3 after earning her Ph.D. from the School of Public Health this year. \u201cIn each country, there\u2019s a really passionate and amazing group of partners who are helping implement this work. It\u2019s really rewarding to be sitting in a room full of people from all over the world who are all working toward the same goal.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The potential impact of DeWorm3\u2019s work for an infection-free world is unparalleled, says Means. \u201cFor a parent, just knowing your kid isn\u2019t at risk of contracting an infection is huge,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s peace of mind in knowing your child can run around barefoot without getting a belly full of worms.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>HELP MAKE A DIFFERENCE<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\">The University of Washington is undertaking its most ambitious campaign ever: Be Boundless \u2014 For Washington, For the World.

And when it\u2019s time for their appointment, the dentist will talk through each step of the cleaning \u2014 when they\u2019re not discussing the Seahawks or the latest movies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>THAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE A TYPICAL DENTAL APPOINTMENT, BUT DECOD, WHICH STANDS FOR DENTAL EDUCATION IN THE CARE OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES, IS ANYTHING BUT AVERAGE.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The <a href=\"https:\/\/dental.washington.edu\/patient\/clinics\/decod\/\"><span class=\"s2\">DECOD clinic<\/span><\/a>, which is supported in part by private donations, provides care to patients with developmental or acquired disabilities, including people with autism, multiple sclerosis or cerebral palsy, meaning they often need care beyond what a typical dental office provides.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Most dental care providers have minimal training in special care dentistry, often leaving them unable to address patients\u2019 behavioral and physical needs. Additionally, many patients with special needs are afraid of dental procedures, and may have had past treatment while under general anesthesia. This means their fears are never assuaged, and appointments can remain challenging for both patient and dental care provider.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At the DECOD clinic, however, providers work with patients to help them get comfortable in the exam chair. And those treating the patients include UW dental students working under faculty supervision, ensuring that more oral health care professionals will be able to treat patients \u2014 a one-two punch to elevate the quality of special care dentistry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In partnership with DECOD is the UW\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/thecenterforpediatricdentistry.com\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Center for Pediatric Dentistry<\/span><\/a>; while the DECOD clinic treats adults, the center sees younger patients with special needs. Through both clinics, as well as the accompanying curriculum in special care dentistry, the School of Dentistry is leading the charge to improve access to dental care for all patients.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Her training in this field has taught her to expect the unexpected when caring for her patients. \u201cEach patient is an individual with individual needs,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd sometimes those needs change moment by moment.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Some patients start out with a series of appointments to simply get used to the clinic, slowly building up to receiving treatment. Others feel more at ease if an assistant holds their hand, or if they can take breaks from keeping their mouth open. And many benefit from the positive encouragement given throughout procedures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite a growing demand, DECOD is one of only a few special care dental clinics in Washington state. Dr. Kimberly Espinoza, director of DECOD, has heard story after story of patients being turned away by dentists who weren\u2019t equipped to treat them. \u201cFamilies were so frustrated,\u201d she says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>\"SOME TRIED SEVERAL DIFFERENT CLINICS BEFORE THEY FOUND US.\"<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Families at the Center for Pediatric Dentistry echo similar hardships; while the DECOD clinic has been in operation <a href=\"https:\/\/dental.washington.edu\/wp-content\/media\/alumni\/DANSpring2015.pdf\"><span class=\"s2\">since 1979<\/span><\/a>, the center opened its doors six years ago, to the relief of countless families of special-needs children. Last year alone, they had 21,000 patient visits, about 20 percent of which were children with special needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The DECOD clinic and the Center for Pediatric Dentistry are important centers of care for Washingtonians, but to meaningfully increase the number of oral health care providers who treat patients with special needs, the School of Dentistry is working to increase the number of dental students properly trained for the field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cA good percentage of dentists haven\u2019t seen a patient with an intellectual or developmental disability while they were in dental school,\u201d says DECOD Director Espinoza. \u201cThen in your practice, you might come in with existing assumptions about what is needed to treat someone with autism, for example. It really puts those students at a disadvantage when they\u2019re going out into practice.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The School of Dentistry is tackling this head on. Students in each year of dental school learn about special care dentistry, from attending lectures on patient behavioral needs, to completing rotations through the DECOD clinic, to providing outpatient services at area nursing homes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cAt my last program, most of my patients with special needs received dental treatment in an operating room under general anesthesia,\u201d says Lowe, the second-year general practice resident who is focusing on special care dentistry. \u201cWhen I work with UW students, I like to make them aware that not every dental school has a program like this; they\u2019re very fortunate.\u201d So, too, are the patients they serve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>THE FUTURE OF DENTISTRY<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As each successive class graduates from the School of Dentistry and more residents like Lowe receive specialized training, the pool of oral health care providers who can treat special-needs patients grows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lowe hopes that more students will be inspired to include special care dentistry in their future practice, something she sees not as just an additional skill, but a duty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>\"I WANT TO BE ABLE TO TREAT WHOEVER WALKS IN THE DOOR.

Stiefel, the first woman to graduate from the School of Dentistry, was selected for the position after years of working as an oral biology researcher at the UW. Undaunted by the task ahead of her, she set out to grow the DECOD program, including the launch of its clinic in 1979.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">After DECOD\u2019s inaugural grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation ended, Stiefel and her team, including Dr. Edmund Truelove, then the school\u2019s chair of Oral Medicine, worked to secure federal grants from the U.S. Department of Education, which allowed them to expand dental training in special-needs patient care and open the DECOD clinic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Then in 1984, after Stiefel testified on key dental issues at the state capitol and contacted legislators, DECOD secured state funds to increase access to dental care for Washington state residents with disabilities, as well as the training of local dentists.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Stiefel and her team also developed the learning modules for UW dental students that are reflected in the curriculum today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt was truly a team effort at every level,\u201d says Stiefel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s3\">Read more about the <a href=\"https:\/\/dental.washington.edu\/wp-content\/media\/alumni\/DANSpring2015.pdf\"><span class=\"s4\">history of DECOD<\/span><\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/thecenterforpediatricdentistry.com\/\"><span class=\"s4\">Center for Pediatric Dentistry<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"The transformative power of UW Tacoma","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/the-transformative-power-of-uw-tacoma\/","tags":["alumni","giving","tacoma"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Five years ago, Tom Rochat, '13, was foraging for mushrooms just to get by. Today, he's on the fast track to senior-level management at a global IT company \u2014 and he credits it all to his time at UW Tacoma.","content":"(UW Homepage, January 2017)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When Tom Rochat, \u201913, purchased his first home in the sleepy, waterside town of Kingston, Washington, he wasn\u2019t caught up in the three bedrooms or the endless backyard or the wood-burning stove. He was concerned about one thing, and one thing only: signal strength. He did his homework \u2014\u00a0complete with maps and diagrams \u2014 and calculated exactly where he\u2019d get the strongest internet connection. Only then did he sign the papers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you work from home as an operations service owner at Avanade \u2014 a test bed for the latest Microsoft technologies \u2014 connectivity is key. Rochat, a magna cum laude graduate of UW Tacoma\u2019s information technology program, made sure solving global IT problems from his remote office wouldn\u2019t be an issue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But before he found his way at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tacoma.uw.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">UW Tacoma<\/span><\/a>, Rochat was faced with a much heavier issue than a weak signal: how he and his family were going to escape homelessness from one month to the next.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Rochat was supposed to be a construction worker.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He\u2019d always found solace in working with his hands, so after the Poulsbo, Washington native completed his tours of duty as a paratrooper in the Army, the decision to go to Olympic College for welding technology was an easy one. He earned his associate degree, with plans to hop on a construction site \u2014 then the economy tanked. \u201cI was ready with my tool bag and my welding hat, but suddenly there were no more jobs,\u201d he says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So he went to work in apartment maintenance instead, painting walls, unclogging toilets and, in a cruel twist of fate, upgrading the downspouts on a four-story building\u2019s shiny metal roof. He slipped, fell and crushed his knees, already beat from years spent jumping out of airplanes. \u201cI was literally on crutches trying to hold up sheets of drywall and patch roofs so I could put food on the table,\u201d says Rochat. \u201cBut I was too injured to work and didn\u2019t have health insurance, so I got laid off.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">His $12,000 annual salary \u2014 the salary that supported his family \u2014 was slipping. He needed a new job. One that would keep him off his feet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Enter Office Depot, or maybe Staples.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI decided maybe I could be a tier one help desk guy,\u201d says Rochat. \u201cThe guy you call when your device is broken who says, \u2018Turn it on and off again.\u2019 I\u2019ll be that guy.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It made sense: Rochat had loved computers since he was a kid. When he was 6, his father convinced his mother to buy one for the family. By 8, Rochat was writing his first program thanks to hours spent poring over books with his dad. At 15, he traded teaching a company how he\u2019d hacked them in exchange for dodging prosecution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI had no idea I had all this computing power,\u201d says Rochat. But he knew computers made him happy, and he knew he needed a job. So he went back to Olympic College and earned a two-year computer science degree in nine months, armed to join an office supply company\u2019s customer service team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">His instructor, says Rochat, had other plans. \u201cHe looked at me and said, \u2018You\u2019re writing papers for me on chipset compliance for wireless security. You can do so much more.\u2019\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With that encouragement, Rochat applied to UW Tacoma. \u201cIn a million years, I never thought I\u2019d be accepted. UW Tacoma was the pinnacle,\u201d he says. \u201cTwo weeks later, I was sitting in my first class. I didn\u2019t even know how I got there.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Rochat\u2019s cohort was one of the first to go through UW Tacoma\u2019s brand-new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tacoma.uw.edu\/institute-technology\/institute-technology\"><span class=\"s2\">information technology program<\/span><\/a>. \u201cI thought I was going to be a bottom-rung student and need everybody\u2019s help,\u201d he says. \u201cI quickly found myself near the top in almost every class. I didn\u2019t realize what was common sense and easy to me was actually an extremely valuable skillset.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Rochat threw himself into campus organizations, joining the Safe Secure Computing Research Group and becoming the chief technical officer and eventual president of the computer security\u2013focused Greyhat Group \u2014 all while selling foraged chanterelles for gas money just to make it to class every day. \u201cI took every possible opportunity because it was a massive opportunity for me to even be at UW Tacoma.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Seizing those opportunities paid off; Rochat wrote a white paper about next-generation security systems with the Safe Security Computing Research Group, and UW Tacoma flew him to Florida to present his work. An employee of Avanade, a Microsoft partner and test bed, saw Rochat\u2019s presentation, called his boss and said, \u201cYou need to hire this guy right away.\u201d Rochat had a phone interview with Avanade that day, and they hired him as an intern on the spot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Six months later, his status changed to senior analyst. He was working full time before he even graduated from UW Tacoma, switching between homework and work work. Three years and five promotions later, he\u2019s an operations service owner up for another promotion \u2014 this time, to manager.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cUW Tacoma didn\u2019t just give me an education that led to a career,\u201d says Rochat, who plans for a long future at Avanade. \u201cThey improved my life and my health. They gave me the means to support my family. The ways UW Tacoma has transformed my life, and the ripple effect that that\u2019s had has been incredible. This place has completely changed everything.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Now, Rochat pays it forward, purchasing school supplies for families who are struggling, lending a helping hand to family members when they need it most. He mentors the next generation of UW Tacoma graduates, guest lecturing on campus a few times a year. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the support UW Tacoma gave me, I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today. I\u2019m happy to give back to UW Tacoma any way that I can.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The history \u2014 and future \u2014 of Tacoma<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At its height, Tacoma was a living, breathing labor union town, ripe with blue-collar jobs and a strong industrial pulse. A city held tightly by navy waters and purple mountains, driven by the railroad industry that chugged through to Union Station \u2014 an awe-inspiring, Beaux-Arts beauty. As it happens, it was the very fact that Tacoma was chosen to be the western terminus of the Northern Pacific Railroad that the city earned its late-19th-century nickname, the \u201cCity of Destiny.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But 30 years ago, the \u201cCity of Destiny\u201d was a city of lost hope. It started with the collapse of the railroad industry after WWII. The jobs left, and Union Station was forgotten. Interstate 5 came through, followed by the Tacoma Mall. Retailers fled downtown for the new shopping center, and in the midst of everything, the beautiful old structures that made up the core of Tacoma became blighted old structures as squatters, street gangs, crime and drugs moved in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But then, it happened. The University of Washington was going to create UW Tacoma, and they were going to put it right where Tacoma needed it most: the downtown core. UW Tacoma held its inaugural classes in its one degree offering \u2014 liberal studies \u2014\u00a0in 1990.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Since then, UW Tacoma has blossomed into a Washington Monthly\u2013crowned \u201cbest bang for the buck\u201d university. With nine schools and programs and an urban-serving campus that preserved and revitalized the city\u2019s historic warehouse district, UW Tacoma has earned a reputation for transforming not just the brick-and-mortar bones of Tacoma, but the students who learn there, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And it\u2019s growing. In the next 25 years, UW Tacoma will continue to provide financial aid to students who straddle the qualifying line, meaning those who are strapped for resources can have a well-rounded student experience and a future that once felt out of reach. It will grow in its offerings: STEM programming, engineering degrees, a business incubator \u2014 opportunities that will fuel economic growth and innovation in a wanting world. And just like UW Tacoma <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tacoma.uw.edu\/advancement\/25th-anniversary-scrolling-timeline\"><span class=\"s2\">transformed Tacoma<\/span><\/a>, it will continue to transform the lives of students like Tom Rochat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>HELP MAKE A DIFFERENCE<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The University of Washington is undertaking its most ambitious campaign ever: Be Boundless \u2014 For Washington, For the World. You can help UW Tacoma transform the lives of more students like Tom Rochat by contributing to these funds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/boundless\/tacoma-transformation\/?utm_source=uwhp-topstory&amp;utm_campaign=tom-eyes#\"><b>GIVE NOW<\/b><b><\/b><\/a><\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Bioengineering grad students seeks to develop instrument-free diagnostic device to detect HIV infection and drug resistance","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/nuttada-panpradist\/","tags":["engineering","graduate-student"],"pillars":["impact","student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"","content":"(College of Engineering, February 2017)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Though many countries have seen a significant decline in HIV\/AIDS in recent years, the disease continues to be a major health issue worldwide. It is still among the top 10 causes for death globally and is most prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there were 25.6 million people living with HIV in this region last year and that it accounts for two-thirds of new HIV infections globally. This is largely due to limited access to medical care, testing and treatment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Nuttada Panpradist, a PhD student in Bioengineering, hopes her research will help change that. She recently received a $50,000 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.massgeneral.org\/apf\/\"><span class=\"s2\">APF Student Technology Prize for Primary Healthcare<\/span><\/a> to develop an automated, instrument-free diagnostic device to detect HIV infection, viral load and drug resistance. The device will allow blood samples to be tested onsite (instead of being sent to a lab for processing) and will yield near-immediate results.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The College of Engineering recently talked with Nuttada about her research and the impact she hopes it will have on global health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>COE: You grew up in Thailand and, before coming to the U.S., you studied petrochemical engineering. Why did you switch gears to pursue graduate work in bioengineering at the UW?<\/b>\nNP: I loved petrochemical engineering but had a difficult time finding a job after I graduated. At that time, in Thailand, the field wasn\u2019t very welcoming of women engineers. So I left engineering to work in medical sales. I enjoyed learning about pharmaceuticals and medical devices and soon discovered that I couldn\u2019t fully turn off the engineering part of my brain! I started thinking about ways to apply my engineering background to health technology, and that\u2019s what led me to discover bioengineering. I wanted to do research that would have a positive impact on global health. I firmly believe that good health care should be accessible and affordable, no matter where one lives. There weren\u2019t any bioengineering programs in Thailand, so I started exploring schools and that\u2019s how I found the UW.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What was it like to transition into the bioengineering graduate program?<\/b>\nIt definitely wasn\u2019t easy. I needed to do a lot of work on my own to get up to speed! Before starting the program, I completed certificate degrees in pharmacy technology from Pima Medical Institute and nanotechnology from North Seattle Community College.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Fortunately, I was offered a position early on in my graduate studies in Professor Barry Lutz\u2019s lab. I also started working with Dr. Lisa Frenkel and Ingrid Beck of Seattle Children\u2019s Research Institute to help simplify an instrument-free device for HIV diagnosis and drug resistance detection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>And this is the device for which you\u2019ve recently won $50,000 to develop?<\/b>\nA version of it, yes. The original assay developed by Dr. Frenkel is called oligonucleotide ligation assay, or \u201cOLA,\u201d for short. We simplified the OLA workflow for use in the lab, but we want it to have broader impact \u2014 specifically to be used at the point of care. So we\u2019re working on a portable version, called \u201cOLA-SIMPLE.\u201d It\u2019s a self-contained paper-based system \u2014 about the size of a credit card \u2014 that will provide a fast visual report of HIV diagnosis, viral load and drug resistance. The idea is that health care workers can use it to diagnose HIV on-the-spot. In about an hour, the system will process a plasma sample and display easy-to-read results indicating the patient\u2019s viral load and resistance to multiple types of HIV drugs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Why is this especially important in resource-poor countries?<\/b>\nAlthough there is no cure for HIV infection, antiretroviral drugs can be effective in controlling the virus and helping to prevent transmission. People who are properly treated can enjoy healthy, long and productive lives. There are different kinds of HIV, and certain strains are resistant to the drugs generally prescribed for treatment. It\u2019s important to get as accurate of a diagnosis as possible so that medical professionals can treat effectively from the start. In the U.S., we have access to labs and clinicians, so when people test positive for HIV, the type of HIV they have is determined and their treatment is tailored accordingly. These patients then regularly meet with their doctors who monitor their disease and can retest for drug resistance over the course of their lives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But HIV drug resistance testing isn\u2019t always available in developing countries, and when it is, it can be expensive. Patients in these areas are commonly given drugs and told to \u201cwait and see\u201d what happens. Often they only consult a doctor again if their symptoms worsen. So, drug resistance testing isn\u2019t always reliable, nor is the course of treatment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This means HIV continues to spread. It\u2019s important to acknowledge that this isn\u2019t the fault of the patient or of the health care providers. Clinics in developing countries don\u2019t always have access to labs and equipment like we have in the U.S., and they\u2019re often trying to serve more people than they can reasonably accommodate. This is why my team wants to intervene. If we can introduce a low-cost, easy-to-use device to provide immediate diagnosis and resistance detection, then we can start to make a real difference in global communities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What do you find most challenging about this work?<\/b>\nWell, what\u2019s easiest for the end-user is often quite difficult for engineers to design and build, but it\u2019s incredibly satisfying when we figure it out. This work is bridging engineering and clinical needs, and it\u2019s amazing how \u2014 even though we collaborate through fields like bioengineering \u2014 there\u2019s still such a huge gap. Engineers and clinicians often speak in different professional languages, so it can be challenging to understand each other. But, fortunately, my team believes in the future of our device, so we\u2019re working through those hurdles together for the greater good of the project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Is the OLA-SIMPLE device currently being used or tested at point-of-care?<\/b>\nWith Dr. Frenkel, we\u2019re hoping to partner with a local company on the production and packaging of the device, and testing will soon begin in Kenya, thanks to the UW Department of Global Health\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tree4health.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\">TREE (Treatment, Research, and Expert Education) program<\/span><\/a>. This will be our first \u201cclinical trial,\u201d which is very exciting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>You could be researching any number of things through BioE. Why this?<\/b>\nBecause everyone deserves good health care. It shouldn\u2019t be a privilege; it should be a basic human right. If I can apply my skills in a way that contributes to the greater good, then that\u2019s exactly what I want to do.

For almost two years, she spent hot, grueling evenings after school on the factory floor \u2014\u00a0but she excelled in her studies, motivated to someday make a difference for her mother and struggling workers like her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">After graduating from Seattle\u2019s Franklin High School, Tran set off to study at the University of Washington. She knew she wanted to help others live healthier lives, but she didn\u2019t yet know which path to take.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>\u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It didn\u2019t take Tran long to start finding her way. During her freshman year, she jumped at the opportunity to return to her homeland, and spent two weeks in rural Vietnam as a volunteer with the Vietnam Health Clinic. From triaging patients and assessing vision and dental health to providing patients\u2019 prescriptions, she helped deliver general medical care and resources to over 2,000 villagers of Can Tho, Vietnam.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite the many smiles and thanks Tran received for her work, she couldn\u2019t help but ask herself tough questions about the patients she aided:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWho is going to provide this same care when we\u2019re gone? Where do these people\u2019s misfortunes stem from? How can they be avoided? What can I do to help and create sustainability in this process?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Revisiting the past<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Back in Seattle, Tran decided to focus her efforts on improving poor work conditions. She changed her major to environmental health within the School of Public Health, and began preparing herself to make an impact as an occupational health worker.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">She interned with the UW Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences and Tesoro Corp., focusing her research on worker stress factors like safety procedures and industrial hygiene \u2014 the same factors she and her mom had suffered from in the factory. With her daily work ranging from measuring stress in surveyed workers to monitoring for hazardous chemical leaks, Tran never lost sight of whom she was helping with her research and work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI can\u2019t forget the conditions that we were working in. Seeing how it\u2019s impacted my mom\u2019s physical and mental health, it\u2019s been pretty overwhelming,\u201d she says. \u201cI never wanted to see that again.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Happy, healthy work<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">After graduating from the UW in June, Tran embraced another opportunity in the name of creating a healthier workplace: She took a position as an environmental health and safety consultant in Google X\u2019s Research Safety Team, where she supports projects such as Google\u2019s Driverless Cars and Google Glass. In the future, Tran hopes to study occupational hygiene in graduate school as she continues to work and provide financial support to her family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The Seattle tofu factory has since been shut down because of its many safety violations, but the health problems that Tran\u2019s mother developed are lasting. While memories of her past may never disappear, Tran is glad she can apply her ever-growing skillset to improve occupational health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cMost people spend eight hours a day working,\u201d says Tran. \u201cThat\u2019s 33 percent of their day! I can\u2019t think of anything more meaningful than making sure that 33 percent of our precious lives are fulfilling, efficient and without pain.\u201d<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Passion never rests: Fethya Ibrahim's journey through mechanical engineering","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/passion-never-rests-fethya-ibrahims-journey-through-mechanical-engineering\/","tags":["engineering","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"First in her family to go to college, senior Fethya Ibrahim is making the most of her time at the UW.","content":"(Mechanical Engineering, January 2017)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Fethya has been a research assistant in ME\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/faculty.washington.edu\/nsniadec\/index.html\"><span class=\"s2\">Cell Biomechanics lab<\/span><\/a>, a <a href=\"https:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/uwmcnair\/\"><span class=\"s2\">2015-16 McNair Scholar<\/span><\/a>, and she has held multiple mechanical engineering internships at Physio-Control, Inc.

In the sixth grade, my teacher arranged a class field trip to the UW. As soon as I stepped on campus, I knew I wanted to come to school here. Being at the UW has been a pretty big deal for me; I\u2019m the first in my family to attend college, and I feel very lucky to have the opportunity to do so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But the \u201cWhy study ME?\u201d part is a little more complicated. I loved math and science, so engineering made perfect sense. I explored a few programs before settling into mechanical engineering. The turning point happened the summer I worked in Nathan Sniadecki's Cell Biomechanics lab. The design and prototyping work I did there \u2014 along with the encouragement I received from Professor Sniadecki \u2014 is what helped me decide that ME was what I wanted to do. But I wasn\u2019t sure that I\u2019d succeed in the department. One class in particular that I was extremely hesitant about was ME 355, \u201cIntroduction to Manufacturing Processes.\u201d It\u2019s a very \u201chands on\u201d class that involves learning how to use all of the major machines in the Machine Shop, and every ME student has to take it to graduate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>ME: Tell us more about your experience in the Machine Shop.<\/b>\nFI: I was incredibly nervous \u2014 I found the Shop to be an intimidating space. I had no prior experience with hand tools, let alone machinery. And all of the equipment seemed to be designed and built for users who were taller than me, with bigger hands than mine, and certainly more upper body strength. I wanted to do well in the Shop but feared it just wasn\u2019t for me. I was also worried that my attire would present a safety concern and that I wouldn\u2019t be able to use the machinery and would fail the class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>ME: So what happened?<\/b>\nFI: I met Eamon and Reggie, the Shop instructors. And suddenly the Shop became a very different space \u2014 full of possibility, and fun! The instructors made sure everyone in class knew how to safely use the equipment. They worked with me to ensure that my clothing would not present a safety issue (I wear a jacket or my favorite UW sweatshirt over my dress to keep my scarf, sleeves and fabric draping tucked in and tight). And then they encouraged me to, well, just start machining.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Over time, I became more comfortable with tooling and machining. I discovered that I really liked to operate the lathe. The amount of work it can do is incredible \u2014 shaping, cutting, polishing, finishing. Once I found my rhythm for running it, the lathe began to feel quite intuitive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>ME: What other skills did you develop while working in the Machine Shop?<\/b>\nFI: I had to learn how to be patient with the machines, and with myself. I\u2019m the type of person who likes to \u201cget\u201d things immediately \u2014 and do them well \u2014 and with the equipment in the Machine Shop, that just wasn\u2019t going to happen right away. I often had to ask for help reaching things, lifting things, and getting the machines to work. But there\u2019s a lot of help around if you just ask. And people really like to help! It\u2019s funny that this idea was so novel to me as helping others means a lot to me personally. So, it was good for me to learn how to ask.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I also started watching the instructors\u2019 hands during demos. They were always so still, so quiet. For them it was all about sensing the flow of the machine, and once I relaxed into this idea, things started to come a little more easily. By the end of the quarter, I was surprised by how much I could do, how quickly I could work the machines, and how much self-confidence I\u2019d developed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>ME: Tell us about your experiences tutoring in the Engineering Academic Center (EAC).<\/b>\nFI: I started tutoring at the EAC through the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.engr.washington.edu\/current\/studentprogs\/msep\"><span class=\"s2\">Minority Scholars Engineering Program<\/span><\/a> when I was a sophomore. I just love it! I help students with calculus-based physics and math courses in one-on-one sessions and workshops. Tutoring has been a wonderful way for me to contribute to the UW community and also to sharpen my skills! I\u2019m constantly practicing my math, science and communications skills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>ME: In addition to tutoring students on campus, you also go home on weekends to mentor students at your community center. Why?<\/b>\nFI: I\u2019m thankful that my community has been supportive of my educational pursuits and for the opportunities I\u2019ve had at the UW, and it\u2019s important to me to give back. I come from an immigrant community here in Seattle; our older generations didn't have the resources to pursue education due to war and conflict in their home countries. As a result, most older men and women in our community are not college-educated, and very few have a high school education.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On the weekends, I\u2019m a youth mentor and teach Arabic at our community center, where we host a range of college readiness workshops. I also facilitate discussions about current events, social issues and try to help the younger generations understand why they should be proud of who they are. If I can be a mentor for young women in particular \u2014 to show them that it\u2019s possible for women to earn engineering degrees and have professional careers \u2014 then that\u2019s just as important to me as earning the degree itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>ME: This year you\u2019re also serving as President of the UW chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), correct?<\/b>\nFI: Yes! NSBE is a student-led organization that\u2019s fun, supportive and inspiring. It provides professional development and networking opportunities on campus and outreach to high school students, which I find very meaningful. I\u2019m eager to take NSBE to the next level. As President, I\u2019m focusing on the organization\u2019s growth. I want to establish a sustainable administrative structure that future leaders can build from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>ME: You\u2019ll be graduating this spring. What\u2019s next?<\/b>\nFI: I hope to get a job doing design work at Boeing. That would be ideal. I\u2019ll also continue advocating for and mentoring the girls in my community. I want to help them break the glass ceiling and know that they have a place in STEM fields and professions.<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Archiving history","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/archiving-history\/","tags":["faculty","graduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good","student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"From historical manuscripts to rare photographs, University Libraries' Special Collections offers countless opportunities to discover the past from a first-person perspective.

After emigrating to the U.S. at age 17 \u2014 in the midst of the Great Depression \u2014 he worked as a migrant farmer up and down the West Coast, where he often experienced racism.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Taking action, Bulosan used his pen to share the plight of migrant farmworkers and support the labor movement, including the Cannery Workers and Farm Laborers Union, Local 7, a largely Filipino American trade union in Seattle. He gained national recognition in the 1940s with the publication of several novels, including \u201cAmerica is in the Heart\u201d and \u201cThe Laugher of My Father.\u201d An essay by Bulosan accompanied Norman Rockwell\u2019s iconic \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Freedom_from_Want_(painting)\"><span class=\"s2\">Freedom from Want<\/span><\/a>\u201d painting in the Saturday Evening Post in 1943.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Photography<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Special Collections\u2019 photography collection features a wide range of both regional and international images, from (countless) photos of Mount Rainier, to photos of the Boxer Rebellion in China. It also includes other visual materials, such as menus from historic Pacific Northwest restaurants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cMost photographers make photographs for documentary purposes, but orotones were intended to be pieces of art, and they\u2019re fairly rare,\u201d explains Visual Materials Curator Nicolette Bromberg. The art form was popular mainly in the Western U.S. during the early 1900s, which partly explains their rarity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">To make an orotone, a photographer would place a positive on glass, then cover the back with bronzing powder, which gives the finished product its glowing yellow-gold hue, hence the term <b>oro<\/b>tone.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Film Archives<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Moving Image Collection covers the evolution of film, from 35mm to Super 8 video to digital. Films in the collection range from home movies to documentaries, and some of the more notable items include footage of Charles Lindbergh visiting Seattle in 1927 and President John F. Kennedy at the opening of a power plant at the Hanford Nuclear Site.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">When University Libraries staff came across abandoned newsreels after a storage unit sale, they were astonished at what they found: Footage of community events in Grays Harbor County, Washington, from the 1920s and \u201930s. The newsreels depict the everyday happenings of life in the area, from school fire drills to parades to logging camps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Together with UWTV and the Polson Museum in Hoquiam, Washington, Special Collections staff produced a documentary about the newsreels \u2014 \u201cGrays Harbor Happenings: The newsreels of C.D.

Asberry was born in Kansas in 1865, the youngest of six children and the only one of her siblings born free; her father was the owner of the plantation on which her mother was a slave. Asberry is believed to be the first African American woman to receive a Ph.D., which she earned at the Kansas Conservatory of Music and Elocution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">She arrived in Washington state in 1890, and became a champion of rights for women and the local African American community. She was a founding member of the Tacoma NAACP, formed the Washington State Federation of Women\u2019s Clubs and worked as both a music teacher and volunteer social worker.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h3 class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">Architectural Drawings Collection<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The largest repository of its kind in the Pacific Northwest, the Architectural Drawings Collection is an invaluable resource for the UW community. Architecture students can examine drawings from the early 1900s or pore over ambitious proposals for Seattle\u2019s 1961 World\u2019s Fair, including one pretty recognizable idea: the Space Needle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Built in 1892 on the spot where Henry Yesler established Seattle\u2019s first sawmill, the Pioneer Building watched the city develop around it, and has become the focal point of the Pioneer Square neighborhood. During the Klondike Gold Rush, for instance, 48 different mining firms had offices in the building. After Pioneer Square\u2019s renaissance in the 1970s, the building was designated as a historic landmark.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">University of Washington Archives<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition to archiving the world around us, Special Collections has also carefully curated the history of the University. Papers from retired professors sit across an aisle from presidential documents, all reflecting the people who have shaped the UW for over 150 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">In 1942, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which led to the internment of some 120,000 Japanese Americans (primarily those who lived on the Pacific coast) during WWII. Knowing that Japanese students at the UW would be forced to leave campus, University President Lee Paul Sieg wrote to his peers at universities across the country, beseeching them to accept the UW\u2019s Nisei students in order to get them out of Washington state.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h3 class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">History of Science and Medicine<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Books, journals and articles from the past millennia catalogue evolving techniques and groundbreaking discoveries in science and medicine. For example, in just two editions over the span of a few years, an 18th-century guidebook on \u201cmalignant fever\u201d had changed the disease\u2019s name to what we call it today: yellow fever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">Published in 1642, Ulisse Aldrovandi\u2019s \u201cMonstrorum Historia\u201d holds the author\u2019s illustrations of creatures both real and mythical, including harpies, centaurs and those of his own invention. Aldrovandi is often referred to as the father of natural history, and throughout his career he amassed large botany and zoology collections from around the world. He\u2019s also credited with inventing the word \u201cgeology.\u201d His collections still reside in his native Bologna, Italy, some 400 years after his death.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h3 class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">Book Arts &amp; Rare Book Collections<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">In a locked, climate-controlled room sit thousands of books from throughout history. The names on some boxes are familiar: Shakespeare, Hawthorne, Bacon. Just a few aisles down are beautifully made, limited-edition books from 2014. The items in this collection can\u2019t be found on normal library stacks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">To artist Julie Chen, books are more than words on a page, they\u2019re an art form and a vehicle for expression. No two of her pop-up books are alike, and they cover an equally diverse array of topics, from climate change to the fleeting sweetness of life.

Now Dulce Guti\u00e9rrez, '14, is making history as one of Eastern Washington\u2019s first Latina city council members.<\/p>\n&nbsp;","content":"(Columns magazine, December 2016)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On a hot June day in 2015, 25-year-old Dulce Guti\u00e9rrez walks down a street in east Yakima, pulling a red wagon. As she makes her way, she attracts more than a few stares. People in her neighborhood don\u2019t walk on the streets, especially young women on their own. And they definitely wouldn\u2019t be caught pulling a red wagon like a kid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The wagon is piled high with bottled water, paper, pamphlets, yard signs and T-shirts. It may look silly, but Guti\u00e9rrez, \u201914, doesn\u2019t mind the attention. People stop to ask if she\u2019s selling paletas (popsicles). They haven\u2019t read the orange-and-green signs, which read, \u201cDulce Guti\u00e9rrez for Yakima City Council, District 1.\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez is going door to door to ask for their vote, something many District 1 residents had never been asked before. They don\u2019t realize that Guti\u00e9rrez is campaigning to become the first person of Latino heritage elected to the City Council in Yakima\u2019s 129-year history.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On Nov. 3, 2015, Dulce Guti\u00e9rrez indeed made history when she took 84.7 percent of the vote in the race for Yakima City Council, District 1. Two other Latinas, Carmen Mendez and Avina Guti\u00e9rrez (no relation), were also victorious that day. Overnight, this Central Washington city of 91,000\u2014where Latinos make up 41 percent of the population\u2014went from having never elected a Latino to seeing Latinos hold three of the council\u2019s seven seats. Yakima\u2019s Latinos had never elected someone who looked like or had the same background as them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">***<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How Yakima made this stunning change<\/b> has its roots in the region\u2019s complex history. With an economy dominated by agriculture, the area depends on the labor of Latino farmworkers and has seen a massive influx of immigrants over the years. Between 1990 and 2010, Yakima\u2019s Latino population quadrupled; Latinos came to make up half of Yakima County.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While the region\u2019s demographics have evolved over the years, in many ways its politics have not. Gov. Jay Inslee, \u201973, began his career in Selah, a town just north of Yakima, first as a prosecutor, then as a congressman representing Central Washington. He recalls how Latinos had little role in the area\u2019s politics. \u201cIt was very difficult to break into the existing political structure,\u201d Inslee recalls. \u201cThis is an ongoing challenge for people of color in a lot of communities. \u2026 Political representation has not kept pace with the changing population.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In Yakima, chances for Latinos were stymied again and again. For example, Graciela Villanueva, recruiting director for the Yakima Valley Farm Worker Clinic, was appointed to Yakima School Board in 2011. She lost her 2013 election to a woman with an Anglo name who had dropped out of the race months earlier. Family law attorney Sonia Rodriguez True was appointed to the City Council in 2008. When the seat was up for election the next year, voters chose a conservative talk show host with a history of driving under the influence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are many reasons why it\u2019s been so difficult for Latinos to get elected in Yakima, but central to the problem was the way elections were structured. Before 2015, City Council members were elected by citywide ballot instead of districts. With this system, Yakima\u2019s white population outnumbered the Latino population on Election Day, and the status quo was preserved.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That diluted the voting power of Yakima\u2019s Latino community, and as a result, 41 percent of Yakima might not have felt represented. To change this, community activists looked to a hallmark of civil rights change, the 1964 Voting Rights Act. Citing Section 2 of that historic law, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the city in 2012 on behalf of two Yakima residents\u2014Rogelio Montes, who ran unsuccessfully for City Council in 2011, and Mateo Arteaga, a university administrator and lifetime Yakima resident. U.S. District Judge Thomas Rice ruled in favor of the ACLU on the grounds that Yakima\u2019s voting system \u201csuffocates\u201d the interests of the Latino community. The City Council, under its old guard, appealed time and time again, racking up $3 million in penalties and legal fees. In February 2015, Judge Rice ordered the city to elect its City Council with seven districts, two of which were majority Latino.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What\u2019s happened in Yakima is a bellwether for all of Eastern Washington. The ACLU has sued Pasco, which is 54 percent Latino and has never chosen a Latino in a contested election. Pasco Mayor Matt Watkins says, \u201cPasco learned from Yakima. No one wants a $3 million lawsuit.\u201d The Pasco City Council has signed a consent decree to find a solution and cooperate with the ACLU. Wenatchee likewise has never elected a Latino in a contested election; Latinos make up 30 percent of its population. The Wenatchee City Council is taking steps to get ahead of the issue and has unanimously approved district voting in an informal vote. A formal vote will follow in January. Wenatchee officials are considering options for their district system, including how to create a Latino-majority district.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cFrom Canada to Oregon, you\u2019re looking at cities up and down that stretch that are going to be models for what democracy should look like going forward,\u201d says E.J. Juarez, \u201913, executive director of Amplify, a Seattle-based organization that works to elect progressive candidates to state and local office. \u201cThis is not a matter of taking over, it\u2019s not a matter of identity politics\u2014it\u2019s about making a democracy that works and that is truly representative.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In April 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court made a ruling on a Texas voting rights case that nullified the final appeal in the Yakima case and others like it. Change has come to Eastern Washington, and it\u2019s here to stay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">***<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Dulce Guti\u00e9rrez is now 27<\/b>, and when you meet her, it\u2019s easy to forget how young she is. While many of her peers are still finding their footing in adulthood, Guti\u00e9rrez often has her head in a binder full of cost projections for concrete, light fixtures and the like. On a sunny day in July, she\u2019s getting ready for a big City Council vote on a controversial downtown plaza. This project captures the dynamic between the old guard and the new guard: The city\u2019s business interests want the city to put up $7 million for the plaza. Others wonder why the city should spend so much on a plaza when kids in Guti\u00e9rrez\u2019s district are walking home in the dark without streetlights.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Guti\u00e9rrez knows all eyes are on her and Yakima\u2019s other new council members. Four women under 40 were elected that day\u2014the three Latinas plus newcomer Holly Cousens\u2014and together, they make up a progressive majority on the City Council. Guti\u00e9rrez is careful to avoid all expectations people might have because of her gender or her age. \u201cI had to change a lot of things, like how I dress,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t go out and drink, I don\u2019t go out and dance. \u2026 I don\u2019t want to feed into the stereotype that maybe a young person isn\u2019t a good fit in this job.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The only time Guti\u00e9rrez betrays her youth is when she talks about an issue that really animates her\u2014like the plaza. Her composed demeanor gives way to youthful exuberance, as her voice rises and her eyes widen with emotion. It\u2019s obvious she\u2019s not here because of the status of being a city leader; she\u2019s here because she has work to do for her neighborhood.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Guti\u00e9rrez was born and raised in east Yakima, and her story isn\u2019t that different from many in District 1. Her parents both crossed the Mexican border in the early \u201970s and met in Yakima. Her dad wasn\u2019t in her life growing up, so Guti\u00e9rrez was raised in a single-parent household with her older brother and sister. Her mom picked fruit in the fields until she was injured, so she decided to open her own day care to support her family. She would later go on to become a U.S. citizen. \u201cI remember her crying when she got her citizenship,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez says. \u201cShe had a feeling of belonging and a freedom from fear of being deported.\u201d Deportation was something her family was all too familiar with. When Guti\u00e9rrez\u2019s brother was a baby, her mom was deported and forced to leave him behind with friends from church. Guti\u00e9rrez\u2019s mom made it back to her brother after a few weeks, but the experience was still excruciating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Guti\u00e9rrez was largely insulated from the differences between her community and the rest of Yakima\u2014wealthier parts of town where people were predominantly white, going to college was an expectation and families had two parents, not one. In kindergarten and first grade, she found herself segregated in a class with Spanish-speaking students. They were forced to speak English and told to assimilate. The next year, she was put into classes with Anglo students but punished if she spoke Spanish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One experience in third grade gave Guti\u00e9rrez her first lesson in cultural pride, thanks to her brother. \u201cThe teachers didn\u2019t let me go to recess because I was speaking Spanish to a girl who didn\u2019t know English. I was just trying to tell her what we were supposed to be doing in Spanish because that\u2019s what she speaks. My brother wrote a long letter for me to give to that teacher,\u201d she remembers with a smile. \u201cHe told me to put it on the front of my binder and when the teacher punishes you for speaking Spanish again, show her the letter. The letter literally started \u2018For the last 500 years \u2026\u2019 and went from there. I didn\u2019t understand what he was talking about\u2014colonization, oppression, identity\u2014but I never got punished for speaking Spanish again.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Guti\u00e9rrez\u2019s brother, who is nearly 11 years older, continued to serve as a source of inspiration. He became the first in the family to go to college when he entered Washington State University. Guti\u00e9rrez visited him for a week, and that opened her eyes to a future outside of Yakima. With the help of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s Achievers Scholarship, she had her pick of Washington colleges after she graduated from high school. \u201cI was ready to go to WSU since I had been there, but my brother was the one who convinced me to go UW,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez says. \u201cHe said, \u2018You already know what WSU is like, why don\u2019t you go check out UW so we can have different experiences in our family.\u2019\u201d Following her\u00a0brother\u2019s advice, she packed her bags for Seattle. She didn\u2019t know it at the time, but that event would set the stage for her groundbreaking Yakima victory seven years later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">***<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>When Guti\u00e9rrez first walked on to the UW campus<\/b>, she scanned the area for someone like her. She had never been around many people of different races, cultures and economic backgrounds. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like a minority until I went to college,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez says. \u201cI went from living with mostly Latino people to mostly white people. I felt weird a lot\u2014out of place, awkward, socially different.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She became good friends with her roommate, who was white and also grew up struggling, with a broken family. Like Guti\u00e9rrez, she was lucky to be in college. Still, Guti\u00e9rrez felt the difference between herself and many of her peers. While many students went home to relax for the summer, she went back to Eastern Washington to pack cherries for 10 to 12 hours a day. It was her first experience living in two different worlds, a balancing act that would repeat itself in years to come.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In her sophomore year, she began spending time at the Samuel E. Kelly Ethnic Cultural Center, where she learned about MEChA, the Mexican-American student organization. She joined MEChA, organized the national MEChA conference taking place on campus and lobbied for the preservation of a Chicano mural on campus, the first documented Chicano art in the Northwest. A career in activism was ignited.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In 2010, the Black Student Union asked MEChA to join an effort to establish a diversity requirement for the university. That requirement would ensure that courses focusing on the sociocultural, political and economic diversity of society were a part of every student\u2019s education. Like Guti\u00e9rrez, many students come to the university from areas where they only saw people like themselves. This requirement would help prepare all students for an increasingly multicultural world. The Black Student Union, MEChA and other student groups formed the Student Diversity Council to lead the fight for the diversity requirement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Student organizations had tried and failed to get a diversity requirement established many times before. Sheila Edwards Lange, \u201900, \u201906, who was then the UW\u2019s vice president of Minority Affairs and Diversity, explains: \u201cTypically in higher education, a student group will come in and they have their issue. It may last a year, but if the leadership isn\u2019t consistent, it won\u2019t be a priority for the next year. The Student Diversity Council kept it on the agenda for three years, which is so unusual.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The grassroots, student-led movement relied on key leaders like Guti\u00e9rrez to keep up the momentum year to year. This coalition needed support from an assorted group of decision-makers and influencers, including the Diversity Council, the Faculty Council on Academic Standards, the ASUW, and ultimately the Faculty Senate, many of whom were hesitant about implementing this change for a variety of reasons. Edwards Lange describes their strategy: \u201cThey identified stakeholders, they identified where they thought they were going to get opposition, they talked to them in the language they value, which is research and data, not necessarily social justice. Even with that, it still took three years.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In 2013, the Faculty Senate finally passed a three-credit diversity requirement. More than 100 students, faculty members and supporters celebrated in Red Square, joining hands to form a circle. Members of some of the different student organizations performed as part of a community showcase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Edwards Lange, who left the UW last year to become president of Seattle Central College, got to know Guti\u00e9rrez when she was on the vice president\u2019s Student Advisory Board, made up of representatives from underrepresented student groups. She witnessed Guti\u00e9rrez\u2019s leadership style evolve and become more collaborative. \u201cHer strength of conviction never changed, but the way she went about the work changed,\u201d Edwards Lange says. \u201cAt the end, she wasn\u2019t as militant, it was more about, \u2018How can I partner with you to get things done?\u2019\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI worked with a lot of different people from different backgrounds and I learned to come together with people based on how different we are,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez says. \u201cThose are all things I learned because I got out of Yakima. I learned that the passion for social justice can be found anywhere. When I moved back to Yakima, I had a different outlook and I thought different of people who weren\u2019t like me\u2026 It didn\u2019t ever occur to me before that we could work together to improve our neighborhood. I learned what others receive and what they reject. I\u2019m able to understand better where people are coming from now.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Guti\u00e9rrez graduated with her B.A. in American Ethnic Studies in 2014. While she always knew she would return to Yakima, she now knew she wanted to work to improve people\u2019s lives. She credits this transformation to her time at UW. \u201cI realized I\u2019m good at organizing. I started believing in my ability to make change,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI started feeling more and more empowered and more confident in standing up for those who were vulnerable. I learned about social justice and service for others above self at UW.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">***<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Yakima\u2019s District 1,<\/b> in the city\u2019s northeast corner, is the smallest and densest of the seven districts. Migrant farmworkers stayed and transitioned to work in food-processing plants run by companies like Del Monte, populating the neighborhood and its low-income housing. The district is more than 75 percent Latino\u2014full of hardworking people looking for the American Dream but still struggling to survive. A former meth house and burned-down shed sit next to one popular park; around the corner, you\u2019ll find an open pit used as a dump. The woman who runs a local community center is frustrated about the lack of police response to her calls. The lights in the parking lots are broken, and drug paraphernalia is strewn near the center\u2019s back door. There was once a swimming pool for kids to keep cool in the 100-degree summer heat, but it was shut down in 2005. There\u2019s talk of building a new pool in the city, but it won\u2019t be in District 1. \u201cWhen I was 5, I was walking to school with no sidewalks,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez explains. \u201cTwenty years later, these same streets don\u2019t have sidewalks. Twenty years have passed by, and no improvements have been made to this side of town.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After Judge Rice\u2019s milestone ruling that created District 1 in 2015, Guti\u00e9rrez was thrilled that District 1 would finally have a voice in government. She talked to people she hoped would run for the new City Council seat\u2014she planned to help out with their campaign\u2014only to find those same people encouraged her to run. More than anything, Guti\u00e9rrez wanted District 1 to have the representation it deserved, and she knew she had the passion and conviction to represent it faithfully. She became the first person to announce candidacy for City Council that year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When Guti\u00e9rrez began going door to door, little red wagon in tow, the reaction she got at the door varied. Some cheered her on\u2014they loved seeing a woman from the neighborhood or someone their kid went to school with\u2014but others lashed out. They blamed Mexicans for the lawsuit or accused her of forcing them to vote for one of her own. Guti\u00e9rrez bit her tongue when racist or sexist slurs were hurled at her and focused on what they had in common.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe biggest thing was to not pay attention to their words, but to hear what they\u2019re trying to say,\u201d she says. \u201cEven though they were being derogatory, I was trying to pay attention to their frustrations. And then I\u2019d relate to their frustration. I\u2019d say: \u2018I\u2019m also frustrated. We\u2019ve never had someone in our neighborhood represent us. By having someone represent us from our neighborhood\u2014whether they\u2019re white, black, Native, or Mexican\u2014we\u2019re all in a much better position to get the things we need in our neighborhood.\u2019\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One experience defines the harsh challenges of campaigning in District 1. Guti\u00e9rrez and her volunteers met at the park one evening to go canvassing. As she handed out clipboards with the lists of voters they would try to talk to that night, they heard a scuffle. A group of homeless people was huddled on the other side of the park, their raised voices breaking the quiet of the evening. It wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary, so Guti\u00e9rrez and her volunteers went on their way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When they returned three hours later, the argument had escalated to pushing and shoving. Guti\u00e9rrez and her volunteers had their seat belts on and were ready to leave when they realized something out of the ordinary was going on; women were getting involved and were even getting hit. Suddenly, one of the men fell and everybody scattered as the homeless men and women grabbed their shopping carts and belongings and ran. Other people at the park, who have grown to become distrustful of the police, sensed there was trouble and left, too. Guti\u00e9rrez had seen plenty of fights, so she waited for the fallen man to get up and shake it off, but he never moved. So she drove over to help. When she finally got to him and lifted up his head, she saw blood pouring out of his chest. He had been stabbed, and Guti\u00e9rrez held him as he died.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Guti\u00e9rrez was able to help the police catch the culprit by identifying the killer and turning over video she took\u2014but that experience sent her into a deep depression and she took time off from her campaign. That memory shakes her to this day; she doesn\u2019t like to talk about it. \u201cI sacrificed a lot. I put myself in a lot of vulnerable positions. My volunteers saw things they never should have seen,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so real when you campaign in an area like this. I don\u2019t wish that on anybody, but I also know that because of that experience I have a different degree of compassion for our side of town and for homeless people. You can\u2019t serve this side of town if you don\u2019t have tough skin.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">***<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Guti\u00e9rrez sits at a long dais<\/b> beside her fellow council members in front of 200 people. The day has come for them to vote on the plaza, and everyone is restless and tense. The original proposal in 2013 had the plaza costing $14 million, with the city picking up half the tab. The city has been going back and forth about the structure for three years. Guti\u00e9rrez campaigned opposing the plaza, but she\u2019s been working with \u201cold guard\u201d council member Kathy Coffey to reduce the amount the city is being asked to pay from $7 million to $3 million.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The project could be sunk if Guti\u00e9rrez doesn\u2019t relent, but she\u2019s not budging. This debate is testing her ability to stick to with what she believes despite pressure. Private donors and business interests were now being asked to pay an additional $2 million under the Guti\u00e9rrez-Coffey plan. But so far, fundraisers had only managed to secure $5 million.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cEnough already,\u201d says Dana Dwinell, her voice shaking. Dwinell, a Yakima business owner, is part of the Yakima Central Plaza Committee, which represents the individuals and businesses contributing to the plaza. Visibly angry, her gaze directed at Guti\u00e9rrez, Dwinell tells the council that the committee will raise whatever amount the council decides. In this game of chicken, Yakima\u2019s wealthy and business interests flinched first. They had always held the power, and now the tables were turned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As she walks away after the meeting, Guti\u00e9rrez knows she\u2019ll get heat for voting for a plaza she previously opposed. But she\u2019s thinking about the long game, just like she did at UW. If she can help the city stay fiscally responsible and show that she can work with her peers while staying firm with her priorities, she\u2019ll be able to lay the foundation for getting the improvements her district needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you listen to Mike Faulk, former political reporter with the Yakima Herald-Republic, Guti\u00e9rrez\u2019s strategy might be working. \u201cBased on my discussions with other council members, I think Dulce is quietly becoming one of the more respected young members of the council,\u201d Faulk says. \u201cShe certainly has an agenda that not everyone agrees with, but I think people recognize her as someone who is dedicated to public service rather than worried about her next election.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She\u2019s being watched across the state as well. Guti\u00e9rrez and the other two new Latina City Council members were invited to a fundraiser for Inslee with President Obama, where they were recognized on stage with a standing ovation. Inslee\u2019s admiration extends to Guti\u00e9rrez personally. \u201cShe is smart, energetic and very dedicated to making her community a stronger, more inclusive place,\u201d he says. \u201cShe is a great role model, and I know that she will have an impact on Yakima and on Washington state for many years to come.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There\u2019s another reason why Guti\u00e9rrez and her colleagues are having an impact. Seattle recently instituted its own elections change, moving from citywide elections to a combination of citywide and district elections. But state law mandates that the majority of Washington cities, classified as \u201cnon-charter code cities,\u201d must hold city-wide elections. Cities like Pasco and Wenatchee are limited in what they can do to correct unfair election systems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Legislation called the Washington Voting Rights Act changes this, enabling residents and governments to fix their own elections systems. It has gotten broad-based support, but in 2016, for the fourth straight year, the Washington Voting Rights Act failed to become law, as Republicans who control the state Senate didn\u2019t allow it be debated or voted on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Guti\u00e9rrez and her colleagues support the Washington Voting Rights Act. She wants to see more neighborhoods like hers represented in their own governments. She has traveled to Olympia to show support, but she knows the best way for her to advocate for change is by doing her job well. \u201cI try to be a living example of how a person can go from believing they\u2019re excluded from the system to using the tools of the system to improve their own lives and life for others,\u201d she explains.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Guti\u00e9rrez\u2019s vision for Yakima goes beyond improving infrastructure for her district. \u201cI hope that we can begin prioritizing quality of life over profit,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have people that work really hard all their lives and still live in poverty. And that is so far from what I want for our community here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m one of five council members in the Yakima Valley area who are the children of immigrants,\u201d she continues. \u201cWe\u2019re part of a bigger cohort of millennials who are in the process of changing the social and economic environment here. We have been operating under a government that ignores huge problems that affect everyone\u2014not just immigrants and poor people. My ultimate dream for the city of Yakima is that we\u2019ll catch up to our demographics.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At that same City Council meeting, the council passes a program Guti\u00e9rrez created. It places disadvantaged high school students in paid internships and mentorships in City Hall, pairing a student with a council member. Giving support and hope to students like herself\u2014this is what really excites her. When it passes, for the first time that evening a smile breaks out on her face.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Misty Shock Rule is a communications and media editor for the UW Alumni Association.<\/i><\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Paying it forward: David Coven on generosity in engineering","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/paying-it-forward-david-coven-on-generosity-in-engineering\/","tags":["engineering","giving","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":[""],"image":"","excerpt":"Mechanical Engineering senior David Coven shares why he chose to study engineering and how he finds opportunities to practice compassion and generosity \u2014 two of his guiding values \u2014 everyday on campus.","content":"(College of Engineering, January 2017)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mechanical engineering senior David Coven has worn many hats since starting at the UW in 2012: In addition to being a full-time student, he\u2019s held research positions in cell biomechanics and materials science labs on campus as well as internships at Boeing and Tesla.

I did pretty well in my classes despite some difficulties at home, the biggest among them being the periods of homelessness my family experienced. Even though I liked learning things in school, I was frequently absent from class because of homelessness. No kid wants to show up at school if they haven\u2019t been able to shower for a few days, or sleep. It makes you feel really embarrassed and unworthy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">However, with support from friends and an amazing high school teacher, I was eventually able to secure housing, which allowed me to really focus on schoolwork and attend class regularly. I wanted to go to college but didn\u2019t think it would be possible for me financially. But then I learned about Scholarship Junkies, and things began to change\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>ME: How so?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">DC: In high school, I participated in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.engr.washington.edu\/future\/k12\/mathacademy\"><span class=\"s3\">Math Academy<\/span><\/a> and Samson Lim, Scholarship Junkies\u2019 founder, visited our class. Sam shared great insights about applying for scholarships, a process that can be really overwhelming for students. Thanks to his advice, and the encouragement from one of my teachers, I applied for a bunch of UW scholarships and was fortunate to receive a few, like the Costco Diversity Scholarship and the Washington State Diversity Scholarship. Because of them, I could attend the UW. I\u2019ve been incredibly fortunate that I\u2019ve been able to entirely fund my education thanks to scholarship support.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">You know, being homeless was definitely the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do in my life. But it taught me that the true value of success should be measured by the happiness we find, and can cultivate in others, rather than material possessions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>ME: What made you want to study engineering?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">DC: Honestly, mostly because of Iron Man! As a kid, I was fascinated not just by the cool Iron Man suit and devices that Tony Stark built but more by the ideas they represented. Tony Stark had the ability to imagine something in his mind, work through it using math, science and engineering, and actualize it. When I realized that, as far as superhero abilities go, his were actually somewhat attainable, I set my sights on engineering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>ME: And you also started working with Scholarship Junkies not long after starting at the UW, right?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">DC: Yes, I started volunteering with Scholarship Junkies shortly after I came to the UW. I loved that it gave me a space to actively participate in \u2018paying it forward\u2019: I was getting a UW education thanks to the help of others, and instead of feeling like I had to repay them, I became more interested in extending generosity to those who could use it. When Sam moved to New York for grad school in 2013, I was asked to take over leadership. How could I say no?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>ME: How do you apply \u2018paying it forward\u2019 to your everyday life as a mechanical engineering student?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">DC: Every day I try to work on the world around me as much as I work on myself. Mechanical engineering has been a great fit for me because of its intersectionality with so many areas. It\u2019s giving me a strong set of skills in analysis, mechanical design and problem solving. I\u2019m particularly interested in aerospace, renewable energy and sustainability, and in projects that have a large, meaningful impact. Because of mechanical engineering, I\u2019ve interned with companies whose values align with mine: Boeing, which is committed to making the skies safer, and Tesla, where advancements in renewable energy are revolutionizing transportation technologies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Building community is also really important to me. Most UW engineering undergrads start as pre-engineering students; they don\u2019t have a home department until they apply and are \u2014 hopefully \u2014 accepted after their first year. So there\u2019s not always a built-in structure or sense of collective identity for students from the start. But we often do our best work and are our best selves with a supportive community! I strive to find ways to connect with others, help people when I can, and also look to them for the support I need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>ME: You hold leadership roles with Scholarship Junkies, on the UW Hyperloop team and with Dubhacks. How have your experiences in mechanical engineering helped you cultivate the skills necessary to be a leader?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">DC: Mechanical engineering has taught me to see through a dense layer of information to analyze the underlying issue, then build an understanding, and move into problem-solving. I\u2019ve learned how to navigate multifaceted projects and how to divvy up responsibilities based on experience, specialties, interests, availability and so on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>ME: This is your last year as an undergrad. What advice do you have for students \u2014 both current and incoming?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">DC: Don\u2019t be afraid of failing, and know that it happens to all of us. When it happens to you \u2014 and it will \u2014 try to understand what you can learn from the experience. Ask for help and advice when you need it. People like to help! School \u2014 particularly engineering \u2014 can be a very intense space to exist in. It seems that a lot of students focus their time here solely on coursework and getting the best grades they can. And when they don\u2019t make the best grades, they\u2019re crushed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I wish more students took advantage of alternative and experiential learning opportunities. For me being involved with UW Hyperloop, Dubhacks and Scholarship Junkies have been invaluable in this respect. And, if you can, put some time into researching and applying for scholarships! There\u2019s so much scholarship money out there that goes ungifted every year \u2014 it\u2019s pretty amazing. Take advantage of resources like Scholarship Junkies. If we can help more students access scholarship funding, perhaps this means more students will be able to take more time to focus on creating their own unique Husky experiences, instead of feeling like they have to plow through classes in four years to keep their student loans down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Keep up with David at <a href=\"http:\/\/coven.engineer\/\"><span class=\"s3\">coven.engineer<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Taking diversity to the next level","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/taking-diversity-to-the-next-level\/","tags":["faculty","giving","undergraduate-student","bothell"],"pillars":["innovation"],"image":"","excerpt":"Students and staff in UW Bothell's Digital Future Lab are not only creating professional-quality video games for commercial release, they're also addressing the lack of diversity in the technology industry.","content":"(UW Homepage, December 2016)\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A DAY IN THE LAB<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">On a Friday morning, students filter into UW Bothell\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/digitalfuturelab.com\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Digital Future Lab<\/span><\/a> (DFL) before their weekly check-in meeting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Adorning the cozy room\u2019s walls are project timelines, a software architecture flowchart, and graphic novel illustrations of a red- and purple-tinted alien world. Rows of computers, covered in Post-it notes and stickers, compete for space with toys and snacks: stuffed Pok\u00e9mon, jelly beans, a foam Batman figurine, peanut-butter pretzels, a tiny basketball.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It may look like you\u2019d expect a game studio to look, but it doesn\u2019t act like one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Aina Braxton, \u201912, the lab\u2019s assistant director, kicks off the meeting by asking everyone to gather in a circle to share their names and <\/span><span class=\"s3\"><b>gender pronouns<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cAina.

They\u2019ve normalized it, Braxton says, \u201cbecause we don\u2019t want to make assumptions about you or your identity.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b>WORKING TO ADDRESS THE LACK OF DIVERSITY IN VIDEO GAMES AND TECH, <\/b>PACE AND BRAXTON BRING DIFFERENCE TO THE FOREFRONT OF ALL THEY DO.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">With a small core of professional staff, the lab\u2019s team of more than 40 students from a variety of backgrounds takes on everything from art, design, music composition and programming to production, project management and marketing. Along the way are constant opportunities to recognize their diversity, to learn about different backgrounds and cultures and, ultimately, to become better communicators.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The day\u2019s check-in doesn\u2019t last long, though: The agenda is packed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Two developers have created a new build for Hug the Line, a tower-defense-style game in which the user helps benevolent creatures navigate a treacherous maze. Then it\u2019s on to critiquing new features for Corrupted, a space-age puzzle game.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In Pace\u2019s opinion, the team needs to develop a unifying thread that runs throughout the game\u2019s individual levels. Right now, it\u2019s not quite there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cJason has industry-level experience and standards for the work we do,\u201d lead designer Emmett Scout says of Pace, who uses the pronouns they, their and them. \u201cThey won\u2019t let us get away with anything less than that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">BEHIND THE MISSION<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">For Pace, who came out as gay at age 16, the DFL is a chance to combine the activism of <\/span><span class=\"s3\"><b>their<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\"> youth with a deep background in tech and gaming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Much of Pace\u2019s two decades of software development experience was spent at Microsoft, helping direct and produce everything from casual games to the Xbox flagship title Halo. And while Pace loved the creative challenge, the work environment was far from ideal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cVideo game studios are still very much a <\/span><span class=\"s3\"><b>cisgender<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\">, white, straight male world,\u201d Pace says. And it\u2019s not often a very tolerant world, either. One need go no further than video game forums, chatrooms or comment boards to see offensive slurs tossed around casually \u2014 or, worse, to see targeted hate campaigns.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">More broadly, the tech industry is often criticized for its dearth of diversity. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eeoc.gov\/eeoc\/statistics\/reports\/hightech\/?utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;utm_term=\"><span class=\"s2\">Employment is skewed<\/span><\/a>in favor of whites and men, and against other groups.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">So when Pace joined UW Bothell in 2012, <\/span><span class=\"s3\"><b>they<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\"> wanted to change that. The first step was hiring Braxton, a UW Bothell graduate who was committed to equity and social justice. Together, the two have focused their efforts on countering bias and toxic work culture. They have baked into the identity of the DFL what they call \u201cradical diversity\u201d: the intentional focus on maximizing and foregrounding difference on a team of people with different backgrounds, abilities and academic focuses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In planned topic discussions or spontaneous conversations, some students might speak about the racism or sexism they\u2019ve experienced. Some might speak about neurological differences, or <\/span><span class=\"s3\"><b>neurodiversity<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\">. For example, Pace, who has ADHD, likes to talk about how <\/span><span class=\"s3\"><b>they<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\"> have drastically different communication needs than people with Asperger\u2019s.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">And some students, like Scout, who came out in the lab, talk about gender identity:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cAFTER FOUR YEARS OF WORKING IN A SPACE WHERE MY IDENTITY AS A QUEER PERSON, AS A TRANS PERSON, WAS NOT A NEGATIVE, I FEEL WAY MORE COMFORTABLE WITH WHO I AM,\u201d HE SAYS.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cHere, we\u2019re not just accommodating different folks.

Scores of game enthusiasts wandered among rows of computers, chatting with representatives from over 50 developers from around the world that were publishing their games on Xbox and Windows 10 devices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Braxton watched as a woman gave Ghostlight Manor a try. A phalanx of unknown monsters, masked in white, advanced down the screen in serpentine fashion. The only defense was Lightbot, whose beams of light first revealed the monsters \u2014 ghosts, demons, vampires \u2014\u00a0and then scared them away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh my gosh!\u201d said the woman. She had just unmasked a pair of zombies, and they were mad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Braxton smiled. \u201cJust to see how shiny and glitzy our product has become, and to see it standing up next to all these other titles, makes me really proud,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">THE FULL PC\/MAC VERSION, JUST RELEASED, IS AVAILABLE FOR FULL DOWNLOAD ON <a href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/559250\"><span class=\"s4\">STEAM<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\"><b>TEACHING, LEARNING \u2014 AND CREATING<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">All of the Digital Future Lab\u2019s games start as research prototypes led by the DFL and Professor of Computing and Software Systems (CSS) Kelvin Sung.

This collaboration has resulted in hands-on research opportunities for more than 50 mechanical engineering students and has helped propel UW biomechanics research in new directions.","content":"(College of Engineering, December 2016)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">PhD student Lynda Brady always knew she wanted to work in the medical field but wasn\u2019t interested in becoming a doctor. While completing her bachelor\u2019s degree in bioengineering from Syracuse University, she decided to explore graduate programs with strong biomechanics concentrations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhen I learned about UW Mechanical Engineering\u2019s partnership with the VA\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amputation.research.va.gov\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Center for Limb Loss Prevention &amp; Prosthetic Engineering<\/span><\/a>, I applied right away,\u201d she says. \u201cIn fact, I chose to attend the UW because of the opportunities the Center provides to students.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brady is one of ten ME graduate students pursuing research projects this year through the Center, which was established in 1997 to help improve the quality of life and functional status of veterans and service members who have either undergone or are at risk of undergoing lower limb amputations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Leading-edge graduate student experience<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Glenn Klute, \u201986, \u201999, is a research investigator at the Center; he also holds an affiliate professorship in ME. \u201cThe Center\u2019s work is concentrated in three areas,\u201d he explains. \u201cOne is prevention \u2014 the more we understand body mechanics, the more we are able to prevent limb loss for at-risk patients. Another has to do with prostheses; when amputations occur, we assist patients as they begin using prosthetic devices and try to reduce discomfort and limitations in mobility. And last is rehabilitation \u2014 working with patients through long-term care.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Supporting students has always been at the Center\u2019s core. Klute himself started working at the VA as a graduate student and joined the Center as an investigator shortly after completing his PhD at the UW. \u201cThe Center is committed to advancing solutions and conducting research to help people,\u201d he says. \u201cA major part of this is training the next generation of researchers to set them up for success. It benefits everything \u2014 the research, our patients, health care and society.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Because the VA is an intramural granting authority, it can contribute funding for project-oriented research, which is often the sort of research that benefits masters and doctoral students the most. The projects can be shorter-term, and large projects can be broken into smaller parts that students can tackle. At the VA, students design devices and experiments, run tests, build prototypes and work directly with volunteer patients, who are often veterans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brady, who is in her second year, is studying the effect of diabetes on the human foot. She\u2019s building on research that was initiated by a former student. \u201cPeople with diabetes have a higher risk of developing ulcers on their feet, and in severe cases, they may need to have their feet amputated,\u201d she explains. \u201cUsing ultrasound and a gait simulator, we can investigate the structural properties of foot muscles and soft tissue \u2014 the foot mechanics, so to speak \u2014 to better understand why this happens and hopefully, ultimately, prevent the need to amputate.\u201d It\u2019s research that merges mechanical engineering and physiology, and the Center is the perfect site for this sort of interdisciplinary exploration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>\u201cIt makes my research seem more real.\u201d<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m grateful for the VA Center,\u201d says ME PhD candidate Jonathan Realmuto, who\u2019s held a research assistantship there for six years. \u201cHonestly, I couldn\u2019t do my work without it. Because it\u2019s a research lab in a hospital, I have access to doctors, prosthetists and engineers with a variety of specializations, not to mention our volunteer patients.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Realmuto is developing a powered ankle prosthesis that will adapt to the user\u2019s individual walking style. To do this, he is developing a learning algorithm that tries to optimize the user\u2019s gait symmetry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cEveryone walks differently, including people with amputations,\u201d he explains. \u201cOur approach is to create an individualized learning controller that adapts to any user.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Patient feedback is a crucial part of Realmuto\u2019s work. \u201cIt\u2019s been very rewarding to create a device, have someone put it on and then talk to me about it \u2014 how it feels, what works, what doesn\u2019t,\u201d he explains. \u201cOur patients have an active role in the creation of our devices, and that\u2019s essential.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brady agrees. She finds great value in being in a hospital environment. \u201cIt makes my research seem more real,\u201d she says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Expanding health technologies together<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cJust a few years after the Center was up and running, we started working with the ME department,\u201d says William Ledoux, also a research investigator at the Center and an affiliate ME professor. \u201cME faculty like Randal Ching and Santosh Devasia were doing important work in biomechanics, and it seemed like a wasted opportunity not to collaborate.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition to graduate research assistantships, the ME-VA partnership has also fostered joint research and teaching opportunities for ME faculty and VA staff. Since the early 2000s, Ledoux and Ching have co-taught graduate-level biomechanics survey courses. More recently, ME undergraduates interested in biomechanics and mechatronics have also benefitted; the Center has hosted students working on their capstone projects through ME\u2019s Engineering Innovation in Health program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">ME is not the only UW department that partners with the VA; Center staff also work closely with students and faculty in electrical engineering and, at UW Medicine, in orthopedics and radiology. But Klute and Ledoux agree that the growth opportunities through ME are unique.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cFaculty members like Kat Steele and Nate Sniadecki, who\u2019ve joined ME in recent years, are expanding the department\u2019s biomechanics research in new directions, and we\u2019re excited to work with them,\u201d Ledoux says. Last year, ME faculty started a biomechanics research group that meets monthly. VA researchers and affiliate professors regularly attend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Collectively the group is working to strengthen ME\u2019s graduate curriculum in biomechanics and, with the department, they are planning to institute an undergraduate certificate in biomechanics. They believe that one of the best ways to advance research is to set students up for success. \u201cWe\u2019re working together to educate future leaders,\u201d says Klute. \u201cToday\u2019s students will be transforming lives tomorrow; it\u2019s our responsibility to equip them with the knowledge, experience, training and support they need.\u201d<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Elisa Pupko and Mike Pope say \"why not\" to being a force for social good","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/elisa-pupko-and-mike-pope-say-why-not-to-being-a-force-for-social-good\/","tags":["alumni","arts-sciences","faculty","school-of-law"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"UW alumni Elisa Pupko and Mike Pope found inspiration at the UW and are paying it forward by serving in the community.","content":"(Alumni Association, November 2016)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you\u2019re Elisa Pupko and Mike Pope, proud Husky alumni and an unbeatable husband and wife team, why not move to New York to pursue your dreams, and while you\u2019re at it, why not become a powerful force for social good?\u00a0As Pope explains, you get only one opportunity with each day to experience that particular day, \u201cSo what are you going to do today to make something that you\u2019re proud of or that you\u2019re interested in?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Elisa Pupko: Bringing the joy of theater to children\u00a0<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Pupko has channeled her love of theater and desire to teach children into a successful business venture.

Today, as Legal Director for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youthrepresent.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Youth Represent<\/span><\/a>, a holistic youth defense and advocacy nonprofit organization, Pope leads the organization\u2019s community lawyering model. He is also a Board Member for the American Bar Association\u2019s Commission on Youth at Risk and is Co-Chair of the Criminal Justice Section\u2019s Young Lawyers Committee.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When Pope joined Youth Represent as the organization\u2019s third employee, reentry was not a topic that received the widespread attention that it does today. Now that reentry is receiving widespread attention, \u201cThe question is, what can we leverage now toward making systemic change, to incarceration, to providing real resources for disenfranchised communities?\u201d Pope says. The number one focus of Youth Represent? Raising the age of criminal responsibility. New York and North Carolina are currently the only two states in the United States where youth over the age of 15 are automatically prosecuted in the adult system, even for minor crimes. On the positive side, Pope notes that New York has one of the strongest <a href=\"https:\/\/fairchancenyc.wordpress.com\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Fair Chance Acts<\/span><\/a> in the country. Also known as \u201cBan the Box,\u201d the Fair Chance Act prevents employers in New York City with four or more employees from asking about applicants\u2019 criminal records until after a conditional job offer is made.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Finding inspiration and role models at the UW<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Pupko\u2019s and Pope\u2019s experiences as students at the UW helped inspire them academically, personally and professionally. \u201cI was a <a href=\"http:\/\/admit.washington.edu\/costs-and-financial-aid\/scholarships\/diversity\"><span class=\"s2\">Costco Diversity Scholar<\/span><\/a> for the UW, which is how I made my final decision to attend. I was very lucky to have a scholarship to attend a great school and pursue theater in my back yard,\u201d says Pupko, who majored in Drama.\u00a0Both have positive memories of faculty members and advisers who supported their professional and personal development at the UW, particularly the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/l-lincoln-johnson-7782314\">Lincoln Johnson<\/a><\/span><span class=\"s1\">, Associate Vice President and Director for Student Life and the Husky Union Building (HUB): Johnson has known the couple since both were students at the UW, and he remains in touch. \u201cLincoln is a very dear friend of both of ours, and we\u2019re lucky that we get to see him every time he comes to New York. For both of us, Lincoln is a big part of our development at the UW and also just our current life now,\u201d Pope says. The admiration is mutual. Johnson explains: \u201cThere\u2019s a joy about them, there is a comfort with wherever they are, certainly with each other. The support that they have for each other, the love that they have for the school\u2013they are Dawgs, they are Huskies, and their connection to the school has only increased the last couple of years.

In the recommendation, she\u00a0refers to Pope as\u00a0\u201cone of the most exceptional and promising young adults I have encountered during my decades in academia. He is a person of uncommon intelligence, drive and passion \u2026 \u00a0and I believe he will become a leader in the public service community.\u201d The Equal Justice Works Fellowship led to Pope\u2019s work at Youth Represent (he joined the organization in 2010 under the auspices of the fellowship).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"http:\/\/tisch.nyu.edu\/about\/directory\/drama\/897670259\">Shanga Parker<\/a><\/span><span class=\"s1\">, Associate Arts Professor at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, one of Pupko\u2019s favorite faculty members,\u00a0was head of the undergraduate drama program at the UW when Pupko was a student.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For his part, Parker fondly recalls having Pupko as a student. \u201cI remember her as being one of the hardest working students in the department.

So where do their stories ultimately converge? Both had the same astronomy class. As Pupko jokes, \u201cYou could say our story was written in the stars.\u201d Both remain involved with the UW, serving as co-chairs for the annual New York Alumni Chapter\u2019s salmon barbecue event and also chairing the chapter\u2019s theater events.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Mike Pope and Elisa Pupko with their dog Zoka in New York<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Though they have made a home in New York and don\u2019t plan on relocating, they return every year to the UW campus and have brought a bit of Seattle with them to New York in the form of their dog, Zoka.

Informed by centuries of traditional art-making methods, activated by technology and fueled by a question. What is possible when scientific curiosity and artistic mastery are given room to coexist? The answer? Anything.","content":"(UW Homepage, November 2016)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For a span of five months, <a href=\"https:\/\/artsci.washington.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">College of Arts &amp; Sciences<\/span><\/a> professors Mark Zirpel and Amie McNeel, in collaboration with designer Sam Stubblefield, filled Seattle\u2019s MadArt studio space with large-scale sculptures reminiscent of nautical machinery brought to life by natural phenomena. With the help of two former students from the 3D4M (Three Dimensional Forum) Program in the <a href=\"https:\/\/art.washington.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">School of Art + Art History + Design<\/span><\/a>, these artist-collaborators embarked on a creative investigation, blurring disciplinary boundaries and uniting art and science.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Leveraging 15th century maker techniques and 21st century technologies, the collaborators developed a captivating set of interactive artworks informed by data from space, from the sea, and from the streets of Seattle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The resulting work \u2014 known as the Portfolio of Possibilities \u2014 emerged as more than an exhibit. It emerged as an investigation into the relationships between art and technology, between process and product, between earth and sky, between investigative rigor and creativity, and between teachers, students, and the community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The Portfolio of Possibilities embodies what\u2019s unique about being a faculty artist or art student in the College of Arts &amp; Sciences at UW \u2014 one of the nation\u2019s top research universities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">When McNeel and Zirpel wanted to understand weather patterns for a piece they were creating, they reached out to a colleague in Atmospheric Sciences. When they needed access to precision machining and 3D printing equipment and expertise, they relied on colleagues and students in Mechanical Engineering. From UW Medicine to Applied Math to UW\u2019s CoMotion, McNeel and Zirpel reach across disciplines to infuse their research and creative enterprise with the collective brilliance of the UW.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>IT\u2019S THIS CULTURE OF COLLABORATION BEYOND TRADITIONAL BOUNDARIES THAT INFUSES OUR WORK WITH ALMOST ENDLESS POSSIBILITY.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">That\u2019s why McNeel and Zirpel didn\u2019t hesitate to bring their recent undergraduate students Tzyy Yi (Amy) Young and Collin Bampton aboard to help with the project. As research assistants, Young and Bampton were involved in critical steps of the design and fabrication. Whether creating molds for plaster and rubber anvils or sketching out equations for a gigantic, conical ring machine, they were treated less like students and more like peers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This mentorship and collaboration happens constantly throughout the College of Arts &amp; Sciences. Students are encouraged to ask bold questions, take risks, and come alongside faculty mentors in research, scholarship, and creative endeavors. And as a result, they gain the practical experience and intellectual nimbleness that prepare them for success in whatever career path they choose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Along Westlake Avenue in South Lake Union, large glass doors open wide to reveal an expansive studio laboratory known as <a href=\"http:\/\/madartseattle.com\/\"><span class=\"s2\">MadArt<\/span><\/a>. Inside, large-scale art installations hang from exposed beams, tower above visitors, and move and change with the shifting light outside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Guided by founder Alison Milliman and director Tim Detweiler, MadArt turns the normally private work of art making into a public act. Once artists are selected for a residency, they are given several months to take their work from conception to reality, the process culminating in an exhibition period. But along the way, the community is welcomed in to interact with the art in process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">For Portfolio of Possibilities collaborators, the space was perfect for translating grand and sweeping questions into large-scale pieces of interactive art. Situated in a bustling neighborhood known for tech innovation, MadArt provided the three collaborators a flexible, energetic environment for forging connections through their work \u2014 connecting the UW campus to the larger community, connecting centuries-old art making methods and technology, and connecting people of all walks of life to art through an unexpected, multisensory experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">When Zirpel and McNeel asked former 3D4M students Collin Bampton and Tzyy Yi (Amy) Young to be research assistants on a big project, the two didn\u2019t know quite what they were getting into. But given the opportunity to work alongside such talented and innovative professionals, the answer was an immediate \u2018Yes.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">During the fabrication stage of Portfolio of Possibilities in School of Art + Art History + Design\u2019s Ceramic Metal Arts (CMA) building, Bampton and Young made molds for anvils, welded and fabricated metal parts, and weighed in on design for a couple of the key pieces that would eventually make it to MadArt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">But they weren\u2019t the only students that benefitted. Throughout early fabrication, students in classes at the CMA observed Zirpel and McNeel as both teachers and artists \u2014 planning, creating, failing, and starting over. They got to see first-hand what it means to be a maker. It\u2019s not always about a clear vision for a final product. It\u2019s about asking meaningful questions and taking bold steps to answer them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">At a Research I university, meaningful research occurs in all disciplines. From the sciences to the arts, faculty are driven by an unending will to understand, to uncover, to make, and to contribute to the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">The pieces in the Portfolio of Possibilities evidence the kind of rigorous exploration arts faculty undertake in the process of making. From a complex spinning ring machine built on precise mathematical calculations and informed by tidal fluctuations, to glass forms brought to life by lasers, these works are more than creative, more than imaginative. They are the result of investigation and study \u2014 informed by millennia of scientific and artistic knowledge and empowered by a spirit of inquiry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">In the months since the Portfolio of Possibilities exhibit ended, new sketches and plans cover the walls of the CMA building. Former students Bampton and Young pursue careers as working artists, and new students manipulate glass and metal alongside Zirpel and McNeel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">But curiosity continues to spark innovation.

She served as a relief worker in Haiti after a devastating earthquake and tsunami struck the country in 2010. One young boy she was treating needed medical supplies that were 10 miles away. Electricity was out, and though many people in the relief camp had cell phones, no one had a charge. She was unable to call for help and, unfortunately, the boy did not survive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This story greatly affected Ahearn, who became even more concerned as he learned how frequently this scenario occurs across the globe, particularly in communities where people have cell phones but unreliable sources of power to keep them charged. A possible solution, he felt, had something to do with creating the right kind of portable generator, but he wasn\u2019t sure where to go from there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Not long after starting the ME program, he learned about the <a href=\"http:\/\/foster.uw.edu\/centers\/buerk-ctr-entrepreneurship\/entrepreneurship-competitions\/eic\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Alaska Airlines Environmental Innovation Challenge<\/span><\/a>(EIC) and met fellow ME students Aaron Owen and Dan Parrish. They, too, were interested in applying their engineering skills to help the greater good, so the three formed a team and entered the 2015 competition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For the EIC, the students created a small thermoelectric generator that harnessed the wasted heat energy from fires and cookstoves and, through thermoelectric chips, converted it into electricity to charge cell phones, LED lights and other small USB-enabled devices. Their prototype proved that it had the potential for big impact, and they won both the Clean Tech and First Place prizes that year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The students decided to call their team \u201cJikoPower,\u201d a name meaning \u201cstove power\u201d in Swahili. With support from the 2015 EIC, along with 2016\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/foster.uw.edu\/centers\/buerk-ctr-entrepreneurship\/entrepreneurship-competitions\/business-plan-competition\/\"><span class=\"s2\">UW Business Plan Competition<\/span><\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.socialventurepartners.org\/seattle\/fast-pitch\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Social Venture Partner\u2019s Fast Pitch<\/span><\/a> (in which they placed first and second, respectively), Ahearn and his classmates\u2014now business partners\u2014have transformed JikoPower from an experimental student team into a driven, determined startup company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>A small device with big impact<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Designed with durability and ease-of-use in mind, JikoPower\u2019s generator\u2014now called the \u201cSpark\u201d\u2014is lightweight and small. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect for rural lifestyles,\u201d Ahearn explains. \u201cSince it uses heat that is otherwise wasted when people are cooking, it doesn\u2019t require anything else from users\u2014they just set it up while they cook or have a fire going.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Though the device seems ideal for campers who might appreciate the convenience of charging their phone batteries on camping trips, the team is more concerned with having the Spark reach communities where it can help make a real difference in people\u2019s lives\u2014places affected by disasters and low-resource communities across the globe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cOur goal is to create a sustainable product that\u2019s affordable for people who need it most,\u201d Ahearn says. \u201cIf the Spark can help ensure that fewer people die from preventable deaths, like the boy my mom encountered in Haiti, then we want to make it as accessible as possible.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">JikoPower estimates that 1.5 billion people across the globe do not have access to dependable sources of electricity and that 1.3 billion people regularly burn kerosene for light, emitting 270,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year. According to the team, Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South America are home to nearly 600 million people who own cell phones but do not have reliable electricity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cOne of the most rewarding parts about being involved in this project has been knowing that our device is truly making a difference,\u201d says ME undergraduate Tessa Gomes. She joined JikoPower last year and serves as one of their lead engineers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWorking with partners, such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biochar-international.org\/profile\/ACON\/Kenya\"><span class=\"s2\">ACON<\/span><\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/projectstoke.com\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Project Stoke<\/span><\/a>, we began testing the Spark last year in Uganda and Kenya,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re helping us introduce our generator to people who can really benefit from it, who need it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">JikoPower reports that Kenya is home to some of the most populated regions in Africa without electricity, and it has one of the largest disparities between the number of people with cell phones and electricity. Nearly 80% of Kenyans own cell phones, yet only 20% of them have access to a steady power source.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a result, phone owners must visit charging stations, where they pay to power up their phones. Often these stations are expensive and hard to come by, so people must travel far distances to access them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">JikoPower is currently working to introduce the Spark into communities large and small across Kenya. The team attests that, with the generator, people won\u2019t need to travel as much, money can stay local, phones can maintain charges, and emergency services can be called when needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Moreover, Gomes adds, with the Spark, people are three times more likely to use a clean cook stove. With steady access to sustainable electricity, families won't need to rely on costly kerosene for light. This will reduce their carbon footprint, as well as household expenses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Encouraging innovation<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The EIC provided the students with a framework to start investigating their idea and the encouragement to make it a reality, and the support they\u2019ve received from ME has helped solidify it. \u201cOur engineering classes and instructors have instilled in us an analytical way of engaging problems, as well as the confidence that we can come up with the solutions, no matter how challenging the problems seem,\u201d Ahearn says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gomes agrees. \u201cDesigning and developing a prototype is one thing; moving a device from prototype through to manufacturing for large-scale production is quite different,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m thankful for professors like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.me.washington.edu\/ashisb\"><span class=\"s2\">Ashis Banerjee<\/span><\/a>, who has advised us at many stages of development and has been very generous with his time and guidance.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ahearn cites courses in project management, design, organization and communication as most valuable, as well as a CAD solid modelling course he took a few quarters ago. \u201cI use those skills all the time,\u201d he says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For Gomes, classes in statics, dynamics, mechanics and heat transfer have been essential. \u201cSo has the ME Machine Shop,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing resource and the shop managers have assisted us more than they know.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Both students plan to graduate in 2017 and devote themselves fully to JikoPower.

As if on cue, <i>The New York Times<\/i> and other media quickly contacted him for a quote.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Greenwald, UW professor of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.psych.uw.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">psychology<\/span><\/a>, has been a leader in the study of implicit bias for decades. The term refers to\u00a0attitudes and stereotypes that affect perception and judgment without our being aware of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To explore our implicit biases, Greenwald and Harvard colleague Mahzarin Banaji developed the Implicit Association Test (IAT), which has been taken online at <a href=\"https:\/\/implicit.harvard.edu\/implicit\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Project Implicit's educational site<\/span><\/a>\u00a0more than 20 million times since 1998.\u00a0There are 14 versions of the test, looking at biases including race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, age, weight, and disability. There\u2019s even an election version that measures unspoken support for US Presidential candidates.\u00a0Greenwald and Banaji discuss the IAT and its findings in their 2013\u00a0book,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/spottheblindspot.com\/\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>Blindspot<\/i><\/span><\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The format of the test is simple. Users quickly categorize images and words as they flash on the screen. When asked to combine words and images that might seem discordant \u2014 a picture of a wasp and the word \"pleasure,\"\u00a0for example \u2014 there is often a delay in response time. That delay is an indicator of bias, and it persists even when the user knows what\u2019s being tested. \u201cAs long as people cooperate with the instructions and do the tasks rapidly, the test is going to work, as it has for all these years,\u201d says Greenwald.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The first IAT paired images of flowers and insects with pleasant and unpleasant words. As Greenwald suspected, respondents clicked quickly when pairing flowers with positive words and more slowly when pairing insects with those words. When Greenwald used the same approach to test racial bias, he discovered a similar effect: 70 percent of respondents paired traditional Caucasian names more quickly with positive images and African American names more quickly with negative images. In fact, Greenwald\u2019s own test results revealed an implicit racial bias.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhen I got my test result I was a little bit distressed,\u201d Greenwald admits, \u201cbut I was even more excited about the possibilities of the method. I knew this meant the test would be useful in ways I hadn\u2019t imagined. The most attractive feature has been the way the test is easily adaptable to almost anything.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Even to the 2016 Presidential election. Greenwald\u2019s Election IAT begins with a brief poll, asking users to identify their Presidential preference, party affiliation, and likelihood to vote. Then they are asked to rapidly and repeatedly combine words and images related to self, the candidates, and the two major political parties. In past elections, the users\u2019 spoken allegiances \u2014 their poll responses \u2014 were similar to unspoken allegiances identified in the test, suggesting that polls would reliably predict their vote. The 2016 election has been a different story.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhen we used both polling-type questions and the IAT, it became instantly clear that spoken and unspoken measures are no longer in sync,\u201d says Greenwald. The difference, he says, has been most pronounced when the user favored a candidate other than Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton in the primary. Those who favored another Republican in the primary say they support Trump now, but their IAT responses suggest otherwise. In contrast, those who favored Bernie Sanders in the primary show stronger support for Clinton in their IAT responses than they do in their poll responses. \u201cThe message of these findings is that Clinton has unspoken support that is likely being missed by the polls,\u201d says Greenwald. \"I'm going out on a limb to predict that Clinton\u2019s vote margin on November 8 will exceed the prediction of the final pre-election polls.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The divergence between voters\u2019 spoken and unspoken allegiances was evident early on, and has only grown stronger as more users have completed the test in the past few months. Greenwald looks forward to seeing if his prediction holds true on Election Day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe often hear candidates talk about wanting to win the hearts and minds of voters,\u201d says Greenwald. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a way of directly measuring voters\u2019 emotions, but with IAT we can see how what voters say to pollsters differs from what they may not be aware they are feeling and therefore don\u2019t say.

Voting in her first presidential election, she realized too late that she\u2019d miscast her vote. \u201cI was distraught,\u201d recalls Hall (BA, Communication, Political Science, 2011). Fortunately it was a mock election in her kindergarten class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Hall has come a long way since then. As a speechwriter for the House Republican Conference, Hall drafts speeches and other materials for Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (WA-05) and collaborates on projects for other House Republicans. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing opportunity to both do what I love and work for a Representative from Washington state whom I deeply respect,\u201d says Hall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Long before heading to the other Washington, Hall developed her speechwriting skills at Gig Harbor High School in western Washington, where she competed in speech and debate. At the UW she polished her skills through public speaking courses in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.com.washington.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Department of Communication<\/span><\/a>, while also diving into leadership roles with UW College Republicans and Young Americans for Liberty. \u201cI originally joined these groups as a way to make friends, and it evolved from there,\u201d says Hall. \u201cIt helped me build a network on and off campus, learn leadership skills, and apply what I learned in the classroom to real life. My experience in UW student groups was instrumental in me launching my career after graduation.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Also valuable was Hall\u2019s experience volunteering at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.com.washington.edu\/speaking-center\/\"><span class=\"s2\">UW Speaking Center<\/span><\/a>, where she provided guidance and feedback to fellow students preparing speeches and other presentations. \u00a0\u201cIt was fascinating and moving to see students become more confident and empowered in their public speaking,\u201d Hall says. \u201cI\u2019d find myself cheering for them and waiting anxiously to hear how they did on their speech.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Matt McGarrity, director of the Speaking Center and principal lecturer in the Department of Communication, remembers Hall\u2019s impressive skills as a coach. \u201cIt\u2019s tough being able to quickly gauge a speaker\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and then turn around and help them improve, but Mikayla was great,\u201d he says. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t just about delivery. She was able to coach the entire speech: content, arrangement, style, <i>and<\/i> delivery.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a Speaking Center volunteer, Hall had to adapt to students\u2019 diverse speaking styles, writing skills, and interests. The same holds true working with Republican leaders. \u201cI love the challenge of learning someone else\u2019s voice \u2014\u00a0their passions, their go-to phrasing,\u201d says Hall. \u201cAnd it\u2019s an indescribable feeling of joy when you\u2019re attending an event or watching C-SPAN and you hear someone say something you helped write. I\u2019ve been working in the U.S. House of Representatives for nearly five years now and I still come back into the office grinning and saying, \u2018That was so cool!\u2019 after an event. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a short statement at a meeting or a speech with the First Lady \u2014\u00a0it never gets old.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Some Representatives\u2019 passions become Hall\u2019s as well. After writing about foster care and adoption for a former Representative for several years, Hall is now \u201cdeeply passionate\u201d about this issue. Of course there are also times when she must write content that counters her own views. Such is the reality of speechwriting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWorking in the House is no different than any other job, in that no one is going to agree with their coworkers or employers 100 percent of the time,\u201d says Hall. \u201cPart of being a professional is reminding yourself that your name isn\u2019t on the door and you are writing for another person, their opinions, and what they are asking of you.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Would Hall <i>want<\/i> her name on that door someday? Right now she\u2019s undecided.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhen I graduated from UW, my career goal was to write a speech that would be delivered at a national event,\u201d says Hall. \u201cI didn\u2019t anticipate that I would meet that goal with my first job out of college. I\u2019m keeping an open mind and open heart about future opportunities, but for now I\u2019m thrilled to be doing what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m excited to see what our team can accomplish in the months ahead.\u201d<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Targeting cancer, precisely","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/targeting-cancer-precisely\/","tags":["faculty","giving","school-of-medicine","medicine"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"Unearthing solutions to tomorrow's grand challenges is what drives us.

Even with treatment, these patients survive less than a year on average.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">That\u2019s why she\u2019s working with UW Medicine's Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine (ISCRM) to pioneer groundbreaking treatments \u2014 and turn the odds in her patients\u2019 favor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">--<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>THE ART OF EMPATHY<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Though Dr. Becker often thinks of cancer on a scientific level, there\u2019s a point where the science of beating cancer meets the art of empathy. Her mother, who has survived thyroid and breast cancer, was recently diagnosed with lung cancer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI appreciate what it takes to go through all the diagnostic procedures, the treatments, the side effects, the stresses,\u201d Dr. Becker says. \u201cNow, I have an incredible, renewed appreciation for how devastating this is. Not only to the patients, but to their families and friends. I\u2019m always trying to think of how we can make it better, do better \u2014 how we can restore quality of life and prolong survival.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">--<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">At ISCRM, a collaborative institute at the forefront of biomedical research, experts take on the most daunting diseases of today \u2014 from Alzheimer\u2019s to diabetes to cancer \u2014 using cutting-edge technology and research to support promising clinical trials.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In Dr. Becker\u2019s case, the path from research to next-generation therapies begins by rethinking how the cancers she studies are currently treated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Typically, she explains, patients get the same treatment for leukemia: two types of chemotherapy drugs. The drug programs are intensive. They\u2019re costly. They\u2019re toxic, with life-threatening complications and severe side effects. And for a third of those patients, they don\u2019t help at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cBut what if there weren\u2019t just two types of drugs?\u201d asks Dr. Becker. \u201cAnd what if the drugs we used to fight AML were selected based on each patient\u2019s unique biology?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">These are the questions she is working to address in her precision medicine approach to cancer treatment, and she\u2019s already making significant progress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Crucial to her research has been ISCRM\u2019s Quellos High-throughput Screening Core. Housed in a quiet lab at UW Medicine at South Lake Union, the facility\u2019s automated machines can test high volumes of drug compounds at different concentrations, finding the best matches for each person\u2019s cancer. And they can do so quickly, giving Dr. Becker and her patients an edge in the race against time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In a recent clinical trial, Dr. Becker\u2019s team screened cancer cells from several late-stage AML patients against more than 160 drug compounds. Timothy Martins, Ph.D. \u201984, director and principal scientist of the Quellos Core, recalls that about 25 years ago, it would take him over a month to test just 20 drug compounds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Once the data were in, Dr. Becker was able to treat her patients with the drugs the screenings showed would be most effective. The results were promising: 13 out of the 14 patients treated with drugs suggested by the study showed a significant drop in leukemia cells, responding to drugs that doctors wouldn\u2019t necessarily have thought to recommend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI can\u2019t yet pick the home run,\u201d Dr. Becker says. \u201cAnd I can only find out afterward if we were successful, but the results are often surprising.\u201d In a different trial using the Quellos Core, for example, a leukemia patient responded well to a drug normally used to treat lung cancer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">But it\u2019s not as simple as identifying a drug that works and sticking with it. A hallmark of cancer is its genetic instability, and cells that survive a treatment regimen often mutate and proliferate. They may grow drug-resistant, making a second round of treatment much less effective, or they may turn into something new.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In other words, cells from one part of a tumor might have a different genetic makeup than cells from another part. If a drug kills the cells from biopsy A, the cells from biopsy B could live on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">With cancer\u2019s manifold complexities in mind, Dr. Becker is working with other UW faculty to understand what happens when patients relapse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">There\u2019s Lawrence Loeb, M.D., Ph.D., a biochemist and pathologist who\u2019s studying clones and sub-clones of cancer cells that proliferate during a relapse. There\u2019s Ka Yee Yeung-Rhee, Ph.D., a big-data expert who is looking for statistical patterns in cancer patients\u2019 genetic mutations and the drugs they respond to. And there\u2019s Su-In Lee, Ph.D., a computational biologist and engineer who works to identify genes that lead to specific drug sensitivity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Which cancer cells survive, and why? What are their weaknesses? And what can we learn about new mutations and gene expression that will help current patients \u2014\u00a0and save lives in the future?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe\u2019re looking at all these different dimensions,\u201d says Dr. Becker, whose approach to precision medicine is one of the most advanced in the world. \u201cWith a more global approach, we\u2019re trying to find new points of vulnerability.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">There is much work to be done to identify and exploit weaknesses in each cancer\u2019s armor, but right now, Dr. Becker\u2019s clinical trials are giving her patients the gifts of time \u2014 whether it is months or years \u2014 and hope.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>CHUCK MURRY<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>M.D., Ph.D.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Joint Professor, Pathology, Cardiology and Bioengineering<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Interim Director, Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Co-Director, Center for Cardiovascular Biology<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>AT THE HEART OF THE CURE<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Chuck Murry shows off a tiny white scar on his forearm, left over from a biopsy.

If the children want to share the sandwiches, how much would each child get?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the second-grade classroom at Lakeridge Elementary, students quietly work through the problem in notebooks and with fingers. A student with a mop of brown hair shares his answer \u2014 two-fourths \u2014 that he reached by dividing each sandwich into four parts and then assigning parts to each child.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cDo you agree? Or do you respectfully disagree?\u201d teacher Nicole Brown asks the rest of the class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A girl wearing a bright purple hijab raises her hand to say that she got a different answer; her process resulted in one-half for each child. Brown then poses additional questions for the students to consider: How are the two answers the same? How are they different?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Teachers like Brown make leading these lessons look easy, but the school\u2019s next-level learning environment actually came about through a deep collaboration between Lakeridge and researchers from the University of Washington <a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">College of Education<\/span><\/a>. The three-year partnership produced a total transformation for Lakeridge, marking a complete 180 from where the school had previously been.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the fall of 2010, Lakeridge faced a crisis: They were federally designated as one of the persistently lowest-achieving schools in Washington state. Test scores were in the bottom five percent, meaning that only one in five students could comprehend math at their grade level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe were heartbroken,\u201d recalls Brown. \u201cWe had been working really hard on reading, and saw scores improve. But then we got the news that it still wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That same year, communities from seven school districts in South Seattle and south King County \u2014 including Lakeridge\u2019s Renton School District \u2014 joined together and with many other organizational partners, including the College of Education, to launch the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.roadmapproject.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Road Map Project<\/span><\/a>, a program aimed at closing achievement gaps and making access to a quality education more equitable throughout the region.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe know that many of our students come from homes where English isn\u2019t the first language, where there\u2019s poverty and transiency,\u201d explains Jessica Granger, Lakeridge principal from 2011 to 2016. \u201cThey face more challenges than the average child, but that can\u2019t be an excuse. You can\u2019t blame children.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With math selected as a subject in marked need of improvement, Granger was soon in contact with <a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/people\/faculty\/ekazemi\"><span class=\"s2\">Elham Kazemi<\/span><\/a> at the UW College of Education. Kazemi, the Geda and Phil Condit professor in math and science education, had previously worked with other schools on professional development, but knew that for Lakeridge an intense \u2014 and unprecedented \u2014 partnership would be needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe wanted to develop a culture of learning where teachers felt confident and supported,\u201d says Kazemi. She knew that investing in adult learning would lead to higher-quality learning and improved test scores for students.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Kazemi worked closely with UW Bothell Associate Professor Allison Hintz and several graduate students to come up with a plan. The team proposed that the teachers come together for full-day, immersive sessions known as Math Labs. Teachers would gather in the school\u2019s conference room to learn and practice new strategies, then head to an actual class to try out the lesson \u2014 as a team \u2014 with students.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cGiving and receiving feedback is invaluable in terms of growing professionally,\u201d says Kazemi, but typically, \u201cteachers don\u2019t have ways of making what they\u2019re doing in the classroom more visible to each other, something we aimed to change.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As the teachers embraced the changes, their students equally adapted, devouring lessons like they never had before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou could see a huge shift in their understanding of math,\u201d says Kert Lin, a fourth-grade teacher at Lakeridge and College of Education alumnus. \u201cI think what\u2019s made it so successful is that we provide kids with tools to show off what they\u2019re learning. You can\u2019t be in an environment like that and not have fun.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">By the end of the partnership, it was clear that the hard work paid off. Test scores rose across the school. Fifth-grade scores, in particular, saw dramatic change; the percent of students meeting math standards jumped from 20 percent to nearly 80.While the scores were something to celebrate, the school saw them as a byproduct of the true victory: students were learning. In fact, Lakeridge considers one of their biggest accomplishments to be helping students who struggled the most rise from failing to near or at passing-level, a much harder leap to make in terms of learning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cEducation opens doors for opportunity, so our goal is to keep all students\u2019 doors open,\u201d says Granger. \u201cIf you can change what a child thinks is possible for themself, it will change what they think they can do through education.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The scalable nature of the program is already enabling Kazemi and other faculty members to build professional learning communities at other schools in the Road Map region. Countless teachers and students stand to benefit, and Kazemi hopes that the work will continue spreading throughout the area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cKids are capable regardless of their socioeconomic status, but there\u2019s so much about the professional workplace in poverty-impacted communities that makes it hard for teachers,\u201d she says. \u201cInvesting in school leadership and professional development can make that change happen.\u201d<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Helping the body heal, feel and move again","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/helping-the-body-heal-feel-and-move-again\/","tags":["engineering","faculty","giving"],"pillars":["innovation"],"image":"","excerpt":"From the Ability &amp; Innovation Lab to the Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering, the College of Engineering is innovating novel devices to help people of all abilities live out their dreams.","content":"(UW homepage, October 2016)\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThe day Jayna Bean Doll was born, May 11, 2006, we noticed seizure-like behavior.

The seizures, a symptom of the condition, lasted minutes, consuming Jayna\u2019s entire being. Medication didn\u2019t work. The only answer, at 28 days old, was a hemispherectomy \u2014 performed on the youngest patient in the world at the time \u2014 by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seattlechildrens.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Seattle Children\u2019s<\/span><\/a> neurosurgeon and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csne-erc.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering<\/span><\/a> (CSNE) member Dr. Jeff Ojemann. The surgery to disconnect the right hemisphere of her brain was successful, but the outlook was dim: doctors told Jayna\u2019s family she\u2019d likely never walk or talk. That they\u2019d have only a few years with her, at best.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Fast-forward a decade, and Jayna \u2014 who lives life with partial blindness and hemiplegia, a weakness of the left side of her body \u2014 is the happiest walking, talking 10-year-old you\u2019ll ever meet.

For CSNE director Rajesh Rao and CSNE deputy director Chet Moritz, it\u2019s the future of neural engineering \u2014 and it\u2019s less than a decade away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Housed in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.engr.washington.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">College of Engineering<\/span><\/a>, the CSNE is a cross-disciplinary hub that brings together medicine and engineering to develop novel solutions for conditions that range from stroke to spinal cord injury. It\u2019s an ecosystem of innovation centered on a shared mission: empowering people with disabilities through connecting brains with technology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe CSNE has become the catalyst for almost seamless collaboration between neuroscientists, neurosurgeons, neuroethicists and engineers,\u201d says Rao. \u201cTogether, we\u2019re paving the way for next-generation neurotechnologies that will help the body heal, feel and move again.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When the average able-bodied individual wants to sip a cup of coffee, for instance, they don\u2019t think about bringing the mug to their lips \u2014 they just do it. But while the intent to move is still there for individuals who have undergone stroke or spinal cord injury and experience paralysis, there\u2019s a missing link \u2014 say, a damaged nerve \u2014 in the loop that sends that message from the brain to the muscle. That\u2019s where the CSNE comes in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The brain is the control center for the nervous system, firing neurons full of information and commands through our bodies. At the CSNE, researchers are unpacking what exactly the intent to move looks like by recording brain activity through electrocorticography (ECoG), a monitoring practice in which a grid of electrodes is placed directly on the surface of the brain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The participants in the CSNE\u2019s ECoG studies are epilepsy patients who have volunteered to assist the CSNE with its research (ECoG is the go-to approach for mapping the origin of seizures) during their one- to two-week hospital stay. There, CSNE researchers supervised by Dr. Ojemann connect the signals measured directly from the brain to a computer translator of sorts and, without physically lifting a finger, the participants practice thinking of controlling a cursor on a screen, an avatar hand, or even a robotic arm. The researchers ask the participant to imagine completing a task \u2014 grabbing that cup of coffee, perhaps \u2014\u00a0then use those signals to enable the participant to control the electronic limb with their brain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Researchers in Dr. Ojemann\u2019s lab are also working with epilepsy patients to explore ways of providing sensory feedback through direct cortical stimulation. In these studies, patients learn to open and close their hand to varying degrees according to feedback they get through the ECoG grid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIn the future, for someone like Jayna who may not have sensation in parts of the left side of her body, this research holds the potential to restore function. Even if parts of the brain aren\u2019t there, we want to take advantage of the brain\u2019s ability to learn and use other available parts of the brain \u2014 and the deep structures within it \u2014 to receive sensory feedback,\u201d says Ojemann.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This feedback could mean helping patients who use a robotic limb not just open and close their palms, but apply the right amount of pressure to complete various tasks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cNow that we know we can extract activity from the brain and control avatar hands and robotic arms and receive sensory feedback, what happens if we want to control our own paralyzed limb?\u201d poses Moritz. \u201cWe can electrically stimulate the spinal cord below the level of the injury using an implantable device, a type of brain-computer interface (BCI).\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The concept is this: the brain activity is recorded, decoded and an algorithm is created. That information is then used to program the implantable BCI \u2014 essentially, chips and wires that act as a pseudo nervous system, creating a bridge to reconnect the brain to the spinal cord below the injury. The device listens to the brain, and then says \u2018Oh, the person wants to do this \u2014 let\u2019s help them,\u2019\u201d says Moritz. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make the algorithms smarter, to allow the device learn in real time. Just as our brain or spinal cord would learn with practice, so would this little implant.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Another forward-thinking goal at the core of the CSNE is not to just stop at BCI-driven reanimation, but actually help brain and spinal circuits to heal themselves, bringing dormant limbs to life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cCSNE researchers are leading the way in building bi-directional BCIs that allow two-way communication between groups of neurons. These devices can promote new or stronger connections in the brain, encouraging the nervous system to rewire around an area of injury,\u201d says Rao. \u201cThe goal isn\u2019t so much to use a brain signal to control a prosthetic limb as it is to allow the brain to heal itself.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For Jayna and other survivors of brain injury, a device like this could mean improving or restoring motor function. For those with spinal cord injury and paralysis, it could even mean having the ability to move their own bodies again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cEventually, the device could go away because the individual has regained function,\u201d says Moritz. \u201cThe individuals, like Jayna, who might one day benefit from what the CSNE is developing are just a wonderful, inspiring, rewarding group of people to work with. This is the kind of research that makes being at the UW so special.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>HELP MAKE A DIFFERENCE<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">You can help the University of Washington empower possibility through innovation by contributing to these funds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/boundless\/inclusive-engineering\/#\"><b>GIVE NOW<\/b><b><\/b><\/a><\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Fostering excellence: Faculty recruitment and retention at the UW","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/fostering-excellence-faculty-recruitment-and-retention-at-the-uw\/","tags":["faculty","office-of-minority-affairs-diversity"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"How to make faculty hiring more inclusive in pursuit of excellence through diversity.","content":"(Trends and Issues in Higher Ed, October 2016)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>This feature is part of the 2016-2017 report series produced by the Office of the Provost in partnership with the Race &amp; Equity Initiative. Feature articles will be released throughout fall and winter. Themes for the series include examining how the University of Washington is committed to improving equity and access throughout major University systems and processes, and how these can be transformed, with the goal of eliminating institutional racism.<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The University of Washington makes it a priority to recruit and retain faculty whose research, teaching and service enhances diversity, and in turn brings excellence. Already, schools and colleges across the three campuses recognize the importance of diversity in prioritizing faculty recruitment and advancement, and overcoming external and internal barriers to hiring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe are living in an increasingly global multicultural world and it\u2019s important to see people of color in many different positions within an organization,\u201d says Rickey Hall, vice president for Minority Affairs &amp; Diversity and chief diversity officer. \u201cIt\u2019s especially important for a research-intensive institution.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Hiring and retaining a diverse and inclusive faculty is a complex undertaking that does not occur in a vacuum. It is influenced by national contexts including pipeline issues, applicant pools and fierce competition for top candidates, as well as internal search processes and implicit biases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The hiring process, if left unexamined, can be stuck in ways that perpetuate institutional racism. Creating a welcoming climate that encourages potential candidates to accept an offer and stay at the UW takes continual commitment and work\u2014but our students demand it, our faculty want it, and it\u2019s the right thing to do. This commitment is also paying off in the progress made across all three campuses to increase diversity by past investments from the Faculty Recruitment Initiative and other efforts; 18 faculty whose research, teaching and service contribute to diversity were hired in 2015-2016, for a total of 47 over the last four years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While we cannot change the faculty\u2019s composition as rapidly as students, faculty and administrators would like, academic units can access existing tools to ensure consideration of diverse candidate pools, mitigate implicit bias in the hiring process and foster welcoming climates that encourage new hires to stay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">First, it\u2019s important to understand the history of faculty advancement efforts at the UW.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Understand the role of the Office for Faculty Advancement<\/b>\nAs a federal contractor, the UW is obligated to use best practices that increase the diversity of candidate pools for all hiring opportunities\u2014and our commitment remains strong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This work stems from a nearly 50-year legacy of leadership, catalyzed by student demands in 1968 that led to the formation of the Office of Minority Affairs &amp; Diversity (OMA&amp;D). Faculty advancement efforts have been moved forward through the decades by Samuel E. Kelly, the first vice president for Minority Affairs; Luis Fraga, the first associate vice provost for Faculty Advancement; and many unsung heroes at all levels of the UW. In 2012, the Office of the Provost began directly investing in improved recruitment processes by offering supplemental funds to units recruiting faculty whose research, teaching and service contribute to the UW\u2019s diversity profile.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Today, student activists have reenergized the call for inclusive hiring. President Ana Mari Cauce and Provost Jerry Baldasty are joining staff, faculty, department and dean leadership by renewing the University-wide commitment to faculty diversity. This includes additional funding to bring the Office for Faculty Advancement\u2019s budget up to $1 million for recruitment and critical retention efforts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Office for Faculty Advancement also works with colleges, schools and campuses on long-term planning that considers the changing demographics and research interests of academic fields, and, in departments, teaching and research needs and anticipated retirements.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe know that student demographics will continue to be more diverse over time,\u201d says Chadwick Allen, associate vice provost for Faculty Advancement. \u201cAs a university, we need to regularly ask ourselves: Are we meeting the needs of the students we have now and, as important, those we hope to recruit in the future? We\u2019re always striving toward that goal.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Faculty diversity is an important part of creating a culture that is more welcoming to students, so Allen and the Office for Faculty Advancement recommend use multiple strategies to attract highly qualified professorial candidates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Use existing tools to recruit and assess applicants<\/b>\nThe University stands ready to assist units in meeting the challenge of diversity in recruitment and retention. Two key things to consider include the following:<\/span><\/p>\n\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n\t<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Search committees can create space for reflection on their unit\u2019s hiring processes before recruitment begins, asking: \u201cAre we advertising where diverse candidates look for jobs, and tapping into the right networks? Is there a plan for personal outreach to highly qualified candidates whose academic work, mentoring and outreach reflects the diverse issues and ideas that will benefit our unit?\u201d Faculty Advancement can help guide committees through these considerations to ensure the best possible recruitment process.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n\t<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Combat implicit bias in hiring by using tools in the Handbook of Best Practices for Faculty Searches located on the Faculty Advancement website, including recommendations for creating job descriptions that appeal to diverse faculty applicants, and many other new online resources (see sidebar for details).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Strengthen your offer beyond the benefits package<\/b>\nOften, highly rated prospects field multiple offers from institutions across the nation, including private universities that can bring more financial incentives to the table.\nIn this context, it\u2019s imperative to assemble a hiring package that explicitly recognizes the candidate\u2019s broad needs and how the UW can address them.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n\t<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Share specifics such as the UW\u2019s Diversity Requirement, Diversity Blueprint and unit-level diversity commitments to demonstrate that candidates will be working somewhere that is supportive, connected and collaborative.<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Identify the prospective hire\u2019s allies on campus\u2014and across all three UW campuses\u2014to show visiting candidates that networks of support already exist. This may include offering faculty mentorship, resource support, coaching and clear prospects to work with faculty from other departments who share similar research interests. Faculty Advancement and OMA&amp;D can work with committees to identify and articulate these opportunities.<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Request supplemental funds from Faculty Advancement to make a more attractive offer and strengthen the potential for innovation and interdisciplinary scholarship. These Faculty Recruitment Initiative funds also provide symbolic support by showing candidates that the University and provost are invested in their hires. Since becoming available four years ago, the funds have contributed to 47 successful recruitment efforts in 30 units across the three campuses.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>A continuous cycle of recruitment and retention<\/b>\n\u201cThe Office of Minority Affairs &amp; Diversity and Faculty Advancement want units to think not only about recruitment, but also about how to create an environment that supports retention,\u201d says Norma Rodriguez, director of the Office for Faculty Advancement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Once hires are made, the work to promote diversity and inclusion must continue; retention requires ongoing effort, especially since competing universities will notice the work of talented junior faculty members. The best defense against poaching is showing commitment to faculty by proactively identifying and building connections to ensure the UW is a supportive environment where all faculty can thrive.<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Bioengineers Without Borders create anesthesia device for developing countries","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/bioengineers-without-borders-create-anesthesia-device-for-developing-countries\/","tags":["engineering","global","graduate-student"],"pillars":["innovation","student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Engineering students involved in <a href=\"http:\/\/bwb-uw.weebly.com\/\">Bioengineers without Borders<\/a> are seeking to create anesthesia delivery devices for use in developing countries.","content":"(College of Engineering, October 2016)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Imagine needing life-saving surgery but not having access to the anesthesia necessary for doctors to perform it. Sadly, this is an everyday reality for many individuals in low-resource settings across the globe, where crucial medical procedures are often not performed due to a lack of accessible anesthesia delivery. To overcome this challenge, a group of engineering students is working to create an affordable, portable anesthesia delivery device specifically for use in resource-poor regions that can help make surgeries possible and reduce unnecessary deaths.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This project is one of five currently being pursued by <a href=\"http:\/\/bwb-uw.weebly.com\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Bioengineers Without Borders<\/span><\/a> (BWB), a UW student-led organization that develops low-cost, sustainable medical technologies while providing students with engineering design experience and professional development. Housed in the Department of Bioengineering (BioE), BWB began in 2009 and today consists of nearly 50 undergraduates and graduate students.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Anesthesia delivery: Overcoming barriers<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">BioE graduate student Eric Swanson is president of BWB. Along with fellow BioE graduate student David Peeler, Swanson has been leading the efforts to create the portable anesthesia device.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cAnesthesia delivery devices like those used in the U.S. are impractical for use in resource-poor clinical environments because they are costly, difficult to transport and require access to reliable power and oxygen sources,\u201d he explains.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">General anesthesia\u2014the type that allows patients to \u201csleep\u201d during medical procedures\u2014is delivered via a face mask through which a patient breathes in gases. In most circumstances, an anesthesia delivery machine includes a pressurized oxygen source and a plenum vaporizer that controls the gas flow and temperature through electronic control systems. Plenum vaporizers are commonly used in U.S. hospitals as they are considered safe and dependable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, in places where steady oxygen and power sources are not available, draw-over vaporizers are used instead. Simpler than their plenum counterparts, draw-over vaporizers do not require pressurized gases and can be easily transported, making them a more suitable option for delivering anesthesia in challenging environments \u2014 combat zones, remote areas and other high-risk, low-resource regions. They are not regulated by external temperature control components and, because of this, gas flow must be constantly monitored by a trained provider to maintain safe and plentiful dosage. This draw-over vaporizer model is what BWB is working to refine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In many developing countries, many surgeries (if performed at all) take place in field clinics or district hospitals. These facilities often do not have the funding to invest in draw-over anesthesia machines, and although they may have access to donated equipment, Swanson says that it often comes with unintended frustrations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cDonated devices from facilities in the U.S. or Europe generally require highly trained professionals to operate and maintain them,\u201d he explains. \u201cMany resource-poor clinics don\u2019t have access to the supplies and expertise required to keep the machines in good working order.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Such devices simply haven\u2019t been designed for the setting, he says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Another big challenge, Peeler adds, is having a reliable power source. \u201cDevices designed for use in places that can afford to purchase and maintain them often anticipate a steady source of power, but in many parts of the world, that\u2019s not a guarantee,\u201d he says. \u201cImagine performing a surgery and, in the middle of it, the power goes out, and you can\u2019t count on a back-up generator to kick in. What then?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Though portable anesthesia machines do exist already, they cost several thousand dollars per device. BWB\u2019s Anesthesia Device Team plans to offer a less expensive version. They\u2019re aiming for a device at one-tenth the cost of portable devices already on the market. Moreover, their device is being fabricated to control reservoir temperature and, therefore, anesthetic dosage in a variety of environmental conditions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Collaborating across campus and communities<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">BWB\u2019s Anesthesia Device Team works closely with BioE associate professor <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/bioe\/portfolio-items\/thomas\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Wendy Thomas<\/span><\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/globalhealth.washington.edu\/faculty\/anthony-roche\"><span class=\"s2\">Anthony Roche<\/span><\/a>, a UW Medicine professor of anesthesiology. When the team realized they needed lab space with a fume hood to develop their prototype, Thomas was key in helping them locate it \u2014 she offered up space in her own lab. She has since become a guiding mentor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to expand my work into global health,\u201d says Thomas, whose research focuses on molecular and cellular biomechanics and adhesive proteins. \u201cI first connected with the team through lab space, then I helped advise them on a grant application they wanted to submit. The more I learned about their ideas and work, the more involved with them I wanted to be.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The team met Roche through the UW Department of Global Health. Through the multinational organization <a href=\"http:\/\/www.globalsurgery.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Global Partners in Anesthesia and Surgery<\/span><\/a>, Roche has been working to increase surgical care in resource-poor settings, such as Uganda and Tanzania. He echoed the need for a device like the one the BWB team has been pursuing and eagerly signed on to support the students\u2019 efforts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cOur project has benefited greatly by having a clinician on board,\u201d says Peeler. \u201cWe\u2019re able to connect with anesthesiologists locally and abroad, and their feedback is helping to guide our prototype design and fabrication.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition to UW faculty and anesthesiology specialists, the students are also working with the <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/gwach\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Global WACh-Coulter Foundation<\/span><\/a>\u2014a UW center that seeks to improve the health and well-being of women, children and adolescents\u2014and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.path.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\">PATH<\/span><\/a>, a nonprofit organization committed to global health innovation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A $30,000 seed grant from the Global WACh-Coulter Foundation in 2015 allowed the BWB team to design a benchtop test circuit, including a prototype of a simplified anesthetic vaporizer. The test circuit simulated a draw-over vaporizer like those used during field surgery and allowed for the measurement of drug delivery concentration and the temperature drop that occurs within the vaporizer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Last winter they received a $15,000 grant from PATH\u2019s Health Innovation Portfolio. The students have used the PATH grant to expand their work. They are also refining a 3-D computational model of an anesthetic vaporizer to account for the physics of convection, heat transfer and drug evaporation and delivery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Next steps<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Making anesthesia accessible to field clinicians and surgeons is just one small step in the greater, complex challenge of improving global health. \u201cThere are so many other large issues at play,\u201d says Peeler, \u201clike the lack of qualified surgeons and surgery equipment where they\u2019re needed most.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But, Swanson says, instead of getting lost or discouraged in the complexities, the team tries to focus on the contributions it can make.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cOne of the most rewarding parts of this work has been the support we\u2019ve received from the various UW, global health and anesthesiology communities we\u2019ve connected with,\u201d he says. \u201cNot one person has discouraged us from pursuing this project, as they all understand the need for improving this medical technology.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This year, the BWB team will build on the work PATH started by surveying stakeholders and end-users in Uganda to better understand the programmatic and clinical feasibility of their vaporizer. They will also more thoroughly investigate the commercialization potential of the device and continue refining their prototype.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The goal, Swanson says, isn\u2019t to create a profitable business; instead the students want to refine their product and develop a smart, sustainable plan. They\u2019re eager to initiate more conversations with potential partners. Private support would allow the team to shepherd the device through the commercialization process and get it into the hands of the people who need it most.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe\u2019re committed to help solve a problem, not just throw technology at it,\u201d says Peeler. \u201cOur desire is that our device will make it possible for doctors and clinicians to save more lives across the globe.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Learn more at <a href=\"http:\/\/bwb-uw.weebly.com\/\"><span class=\"s2\">http:\/\/bwb-uw.weebly.com<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Husky on the Hill: Spotlight on Sen.

Steve Hobbs of Lake Stevens says he owes his career to a love of learning nurtured by the University of Washington (UW).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Earning a degree from the UW was a life-long goal, Hobbs says, but it was one he thought he\u2019d never attain. After working through high school to help support his family, Hobbs earned an associate\u2019s degree from Everett Community College. An accommodating educational transfer program opened to him the world of four-year university instruction, and Hobbs graduated from UW with a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science in 1994. He later earned a Master\u2019s Degree in Public Administration from the Evans School of Public Policy and Governance in 2011.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Since 2006 Hobbs has represented Washington\u2019s 44th District, even while serving as a major in Washington\u2019s Army National Guard. He is the top Democrat on the Senate transportation committee, and also serves on Agriculture; Water &amp; Rural Economic Development; and the Financial Institutions &amp; Insurance Committee.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When he\u2019s not busy in Olympia, Hobbs can be found reading comics, gaming or spending time with his family. Hobbs is a father of three, and he\u2019s been married to his wife Pam since 1995.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We took a few minutes to talk to the senator about his goals for Washington\u2019s higher education policies over the next legislative session and about how his experience at the University of Washington helped to shape those goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>1. What motivated you to run for office?<\/b>\nIt sounds cheesy but there wasn\u2019t any one thing, just a sense of public service that I\u2019ve had since I joined the army. The sense of serving my community and working the public sector for the public good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>2. What are your legislative priorities this session?<\/b>\nTrying to solve the McCleary issue is a big deal. Within my own district, I\u2019ll be focusing to ensure the needs of my constituency are being met; Capital needs and transportation issues for the people of the 44th District. We\u2019ll have to deal with issues of mental health because of the recent lawsuit there, but I think the majority of the session will be dealing with McCleary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>3. What do you think the long-term outlook is for higher education in our state?<\/b>\nThe past few years have been pretty good for higher education. We\u2019ve been investing in higher education and holding tuition pretty much steady. As long as we don\u2019t have another major recession, I think higher education will be fine. Though there are always small fights over resources each session.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>4. How do you spend your time when the legislature is not in session?<\/b>\nI\u2019m a big nerd. I spend my time with a group of volunteers called OrcaCon, a table top gaming convention that takes a whole year to plan. I have a podcast for it, and I love playing Splendor, Axis and Allies, and another game called Dixit-the whole family can play. I also do a lot of comic book reading. It\u2019s an escape. I do a lot of reading in general of policy papers and analysis papers, and it\u2019s so nice to pick up an issue of Dr. Strange, for example, and enjoy a little bit of a different universe. I started really young playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and that\u2019s just expanded. We\u2019re going to do a table game day at the National Guard base.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>5. Do you have a favorite UW memory?<\/b>\nI\u2019d always wanted to go to the University of Washington, and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d make it there. I came from a relatively poor family, and I had a part-time job in high school that made it hard to maintain those grades. When I finally transferred, at orientation day, I don\u2019t think there was a moment I didn\u2019t say to myself \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m here.\u201d I love the institution, and my hope is that we can provide the opportunity to other young people who want to go to school at UW or any of the four-year schools here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>6. What kind of an impact has your UW education had on your life?<\/b>\nIt opened up the world for me. It gave me opportunity and hope that I can do other things. The great thing about the University of Washington and other four-year institutions is that their students come from around the world, and the friends you meet and the relationships you make are wonderful. If I could do it over again I\u2019d try to find the opportunity to live on campus. I think I missed out. I didn\u2019t get to go to the football games, and I regret that. I\u2019m hoping if my son goes he\u2019ll have the chance. Everyone who can should do that.\nWhen I became state senator and I got to go back to the UW Evans School of Public Policy and Governance for my grad degree\u2014and what a fantastic degree\u2014I could use the classes I was taking at the time and apply them immediately. It\u2019s made me a better senator for sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>7. What advice do you have for other alumni who want to ensure that the UW will continue to have a strong future for generations of Huskies to come?<\/b>\nJust pay attention to what your legislature is doing. I know everyone is fascinated with the presidential race, but really the governmental institutions that affect what\u2019s going on here, from your local schools to the University of Washington, is the state Legislature.<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"On the research track","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/on-the-research-track\/","tags":["alumni","arts-sciences","giving"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Jennifer Smith, '16, had been a high school dropout.

We were at very different places in our lives.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It didn\u2019t take long, though, for Smith to find her focus. Supported by a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/undergradresearch\/students\/funding\/marygates-research\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Mary Gates Research Scholarship<\/span><\/a> and accepted into the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/undergradresearch\/summer\/siah\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Summer Institute in the Arts and Humanities<\/span><\/a>, she was able to immerse herself in research.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The program not only gave her the opportunity to develop a research idea, it also taught her what was possible when she combined her growing interests in history, politics and Indigenous communities with what she knew best: horses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In her years as an assistant racehorse trainer, Smith iced and bandaged horses\u2019 legs to prevent injuries, managed feeding and veterinary schedules, supervised barn employees and kept in constant contact with the lead trainers and owners. She and her children even adopted a former racehorse \u2014 a 17-hand dark bay gelding named Pirate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">So when it came time to choose a research topic, she says, \u201cI found a great way to marry my past and my present.\u201d At the end of the summer of rigorous research, Smith had produced an analysis of a cross-cultural debate on managing populations of wild horses on Yakama tribal lands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cAfter that,\u201d she says, \u201cI wanted to continue doing research because it allowed me to combine what I learned in the classroom with something that was independent \u2014 and was mine.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Smith was able to dive deeper into her topic with the help of another Mary Gates Research Scholarship, a <a href=\"https:\/\/chid.washington.edu\/chid-scholarships\"><span class=\"s2\">Comparative History of Ideas Research Scholarship <\/span><\/a>and the History Department\u2019s Faye Wilson Scholarship, among others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Two more quarters of historical research and a quarter of independent study took her deep into the history of the Yakama Nation\u2019s relationship with the U.S. government. Into the tangled complexities of symbolism, environmental degradation and tribal sovereignty. Into a conflict in which the very animals she knew and loved were at the heart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The subject provoked mixed emotions and heartbreak, but for Smith, it was the intricacy of her research that made her want to keep going. \u201cOnce I found this topic, I knew that I wanted to do as much as I could with it,\u201d she says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition to easing her financial burdens, the scholarships she received reinforced Smith\u2019s belief in herself. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t go through high school, I lack a lot of confidence at times,\u201d she says. \u201cSo to have other people see that there is value in me as an academic, in my research, has been wonderful.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Smith sought out opportunities to share her ideas \u2014 she presented at the National Conference on Undergraduate Research and twice at the UW\u2019s Undergraduate Research Symposium. As an Undergraduate Research Leader, she helped other students find ways to match their interests with research in the humanities and social sciences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI just want students to know that their work is valuable and has the potential to earn funding and acknowledgment,\u201d she says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Smith graduated in June with degrees in <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/history\/department-history\"><span class=\"s2\">history<\/span><\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/chid.washington.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">comparative history of ideas<\/span><\/a>, and was named the Dean\u2019s Medalist in the Humanities. This fall, she starts graduate studies at the UW in history. She looks forward to working with her adviser, Josh Reid, an associate professor of history and prominent Native scholar, as she continues to explore the topic she\u2019s most passionate about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI just hope that my work helps people better understand why things are the way they are and what needs to change,\u201d she says. \u201cMy goal isn\u2019t trying to speak for anybody, but finding the evidence, writing the story and letting the story speak for itself.\u201d<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"The impact of PrEP","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/the-impact-of-prep\/","tags":["arts-sciences","faculty"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"A UW anthropologist explores the potential impact of making an HIV prevention drug more available to teens.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, September 2016)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Though more than two million people in the US are HIV positive\u00a0\u2014 with more cases diagnosed each year\u00a0\u2014 the human immunodeficiency virus no longer grabs headlines. A pill that helps prevent HIV isn\u2019t grabbing headlines either. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) wants to spread the word about this pill, an oral preexposure prophylaxis known as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/hiv\/risk\/prep\/\"><span class=\"s2\">PrEP<\/span><\/a>, but figuring out the best way to reach the target populations is a challenge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Through a five-year CDC contract, UW professor Steve Goodreau and colleagues at Emory University are analyzing populations that would benefit from the medication and are predicting the pill\u2019s potential impact based on a range of variables. They are now looking at the costs and benefits of approving PrEP for minors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cPrEP is approved for use by adults 18 years or older,\u201d explains Goodreau, associate professor of <a href=\"https:\/\/anthropology.washington.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">anthropology<\/span><\/a>. \u201cPrescribing PrEP for those under 18 is a big gray area right now, and few providers are willing to do it. But by the time they turn 18, somewhere around seven to ten percent of gay and bisexual males will be HIV positive, at least in some cities. Waiting until they are 18 is too late for a lot of kids. The CDC thinks it\u2019s worth considering strengthening their recommendations around PrEP and adolescents, but before they go ahead with that, they want as much evidence as possible that it would be worth doing so. They know there will be pushback, since it raises a lot of sensitive issues.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Those issues have come up before, with the introduction of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/hpv\/index.html?s_cid=bb-HPV-NCIRD-Con-search-1\"><span class=\"s2\">HPV vaccine<\/span><\/a>, which prevents a virus that can cause cervical cancer and other health problems. The HPV vaccine works best if taken before an adolescent becomes sexually active, but many parents have balked at scheduling the vaccine, not wanting to think about their child having sex. And some sexually active girls have wanted the vaccine but were unwilling to tell their parents, raising the thorny issue of parental consent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">PrEP raises the same issues, with added complications. Unlike the HPV vaccine, which involves a series of three shots, PrEP must be taken on an ongoing basis. And the young people needing it most would be male adolescents having sex with other males. \u201cThat\u2019s an additional discomfort that parents might not want to think about, or know about, or realize applies to their child,\u201d says Goodreau. \u201cBut with a considerable number of teenage males getting HIV by the time they are 18, we have to think about it, whether we want to or not.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are other tools for preventing HIV, most notably the condom. But, says Goodreau, \u201cthe fact that we still have unwanted pregnancies and we still have HIV transmission means that condoms don\u2019t work for everyone all the time. PrEP is another tool in the toolkit. Taken daily, it can almost entirely prevent someone from getting HIV. Nothing is certain, but this is pretty close.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Goodreau uses computer models to predict the impact of adolescents using PrEP and the optimal point for introducing the medication. \u201cIs it worth trying to reach teens before they are sexually active, knowing that would be more difficult but would provide maximum protection?\u201d asks Goodreau. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get to teens until six months after they sexually debut, is that too late or does it still give us most of the benefits? Those are the kinds of things we\u2019re looking at.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In his computer models, Goodreau considers factors like age, onset of sexual activity, sexual networks, number of sexual partners, and openness to regular HIV testing.\u00a0 He uses data from existing surveys, including a nationwide online survey for men who have sex with men, and an annual health survey of high school students that covers sexual behavior, alcohol and drug use, exercise, diet, and more. Goodreau also uses data from an ongoing PrEP trial, including information about adolescents\u2019 willingness to start PrEP and stay on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The models give the CDC a better sense of how many cases of HIV would likely be prevented, and at what cost, with different guidelines. The findings could lead to targeted outreach to teens, a revision in guidelines for doctors prescribing PrEP to teens, and other changes. For Goodreau, knowing that his work may have an impact on health policy is motivating.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cModelling is good at asking, \u2018If you could do X, what would the impact be?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cSome reseachers model things that are completely impossible, but I\u2019m not interested in working on a project where X is completely impossible. As a social scientist, I always want to work on things that can be implemented. This PrEP study is a great example of that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"A true gift of creativity","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/a-true-gift-of-creativity\/","tags":["arts-sciences","faculty","giving","graduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Grad students in diverse creative fields collaborated through a summer colloquium, Multiplying Mediums.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, September 2016)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Tucked behind athletic fields at the far reaches of the UW campus, the Ceramic and Metal Arts Building (CMA) is a second home for art students in the 3D4M program. But this summer CMA welcomed students from a wide swath of creative fields\u00a0\u2014 poetry, painting, set design, sculpture, photomedia, dance\u00a0\u2014 for a six-week colloquium that sparked unusual artistic collaborations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The colloquium, Multiplying Mediums, was offered jointly by the <a href=\"https:\/\/english.washington.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Department of English<\/span><\/a><\/span> <span class=\"s1\">and the<a href=\"https:\/\/art.washington.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\"> School of Art + Art History + Design<\/span><\/a>, with funding from Bill and Ruth True. The ten participants\u00a0\u2014 all UW graduate students\u00a0\u2014 received generous summer scholarships to focus on their creative work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cEspecially at the graduate level, different disciplines can stay pretty isolated from each other,\u201d says Erin Lynch, an MFA student in poetry. \u201cMultiplying Mediums was a great opportunity to grow with and from other artists, as well as garner inspiration from others\u2019 processes and passions.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The faculty who developed the course also learned from each other. Andrew Feld, associate professor of poetry and director of the <a href=\"https:\/\/english.washington.edu\/master-fine-arts-creative-writing\"><span class=\"s2\">Creative Writing Program<\/span><\/a>, and Michael Swaine, assistant professor of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/art.washington.edu\/art\/3d4m-ceramics-glass-sculpture\"><span class=\"s2\">3D4M <\/span><\/a>(three-dimensional forum), were strangers when they agreed to plan and lead the colloquium. \u201cWe had to figure out how to mesh these two creative disciplines that don\u2019t talk to each other that much,\u201d recalls Swaine. \u201cIt was a little bit like a blind date. We put the students in that situation as well.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For the first few weeks, Feld and Swaine had students collaborate in various combinations for small projects, with the stipulation that they never work with someone in their own discipline. For the final three weeks, the students collaborated in teams of two or three to develop a more ambitious final project. The resulting works ran the gamut from an installation with words grouped and suspended from the rafters like mobiles, to a performance piece that combined video, text, and movement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The latter piece, which loosely explored the female body\u2019s relationship with water, was created by a poet, a dancer, and a photomedia artist. The trio found they were simpatico from the start. \u201cWe came to the project with so much conceptual and aesthetic overlap, and asking a lot of the same questions,\u201d says Lynch. \u201cThe synchronicity was crazy. We kept looking at each other and saying, \u2018Wow, this is eerie.\u2019\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Another project paired a poet and a sculptor who created a cave-like space from metal wire, wood, and plaster. Visitors stepping inside the structure\u00a0were surrounded by suspended, interwoven strips of fabric with writing on them. Poet Cameron Louie says the project changed him.\u00a0 \u201cAt one point, after spending a couple of weeks obsessively covering this huge structure in plaster, I was joking to the rest of the group that I was going to need to reconsider my whole identity, as in, \u2018Am I even a poet anymore? Am I a sculptor now?\u2019 Which is obviously ridiculous, because I haven\u2019t the skills or the training to be a sculptor\u00a0\u2014 but that was kind of the whole point. Multiplying Mediums wasn\u2019t just about producing new, groundbreaking work, but about doing things that you\u2019d never usually do, breaking out of calcified forms\u00a0\u2014 which is fundamental to being an artist.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That message was underscored by numerous guest speakers who visited the class, from writers to instrument makers to mixed-media artists.\u00a0 \u201cWe looked for people doing inspiring projects that weren\u2019t necessarily something the students could copy in method but from which they could glean inspiration,\u201d says Swaine. Donor Bill True, an art collector and poet, visited frequently to hear the guest speakers and to follow the students\u2019 progress. \u201cBill had a much fuller role than I originally imagined, which was great,\u201d says Swaine. \u201cHe even invited the whole group to his house for an amazing dinner, where we were given a tour of part of his world-class art collection. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for all of us.\u201d Adds Lynch, \u201cDespite his stores of knowledge and his clout in the art world, Bill had a genuine, humble delight in watching the creative process as well as learning about us as people.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At the end of the six-week program, the Trues and others attended a public exhibition at which the students presented and spoke about their final projects. The event provided a motivating deadline for the students as well as an opportunity to celebrate their accomplishments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI think the biggest takeaway for me was the freedom to play,\u201d says Clare Halpine, a graduate student in photomedia. \u201cIn creating work in such a short time\u00a0\u2014 22 days in our collaborative groups\u00a0\u2014 there isn\u2019t a lot of time to question or doubt. You have to move with it\u2014trust the idea, yourself, your intuition, and your partners.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Swaine and Feld hope Multiplying Mediums will be offered again, having witnessed how it builds bridges between creative disciplines that interact infrequently at the UW. Many of the participating students, buoyed by the experience, are still in touch and considering future collaborations across the creative arts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThere\u2019s a long tradition of artists crossing disciplines to do strange, amazing things, and in a time where it\u2019s so easy\u00a0\u2014 even encouraged\u00a0\u2014 to work alone, I\u2019m completely convinced that collaboration will keep us human,\u201d says Louie. \u201cCollaboration is a political, artistic, and emotional necessity. Good things will happen if we continue to work like this.\u201d<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"A celebration of female poppers","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/a-celebration-of-female-poppers\/","tags":["arts-sciences","giving","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Dance major Angel Langley celebrates women dancing\u00a0in the hip hop style known as popping.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, September 2016)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dance major Angel Langley was nine years old when her father won six months of dance lessons for her in a raffle. As a teen, she tried social ballroom dancing and studied modern dance at Velocity Dance Center on her own dime.\u00a0 But it was a hip hop dance battle that intensified her commitment to dance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI remember how people supported each other,\u201d Langley says of watching her first battle, held in the student union building at Highline Community College. During battles, dancers take turns competing within a circle formed by the audience. Other dancers encouraged Langley to take a turn that day. While she decided she wasn\u2019t ready for that, she was hooked on hip hop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It would be two more years before Langley finally competed. Her hesitation came, in part, from the dearth of female participants. \u201cIt was male dominated,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was a lot of hubris, a lot of testosterone in the air. The girls who did dance, it was all sexualized. That\u2019s okay, but you shouldn\u2019t feel like you <i>have<\/i> to dance like that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When Langley did eventually compete, she performed in her preferred hip hop style, popping. \u201cIn popping, the point is to accent a beat or shape in the music, like orchestrating your body to the music,\u201d Langley says. \u201cIt\u2019s very illusionary. It\u2019s like painting with your whole body.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">All hip hop is male dominated, but popping is particularly so. After a few years as the only female visibly aspiring to do popping in Seattle, Langley\u00a0\u2014 by then a UW honors student majoring in <a href=\"https:\/\/dance.washington.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">dance\u00a0<\/span><\/a>\u2014 decided to do an ethnographic research project about female poppers. She presented the resulting paper at an academic conference, UC-Riverside\u2019s Show &amp; Prove Hip Hop Studies Conference, with support from a Mary Gates Travel Scholarship.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But Langley wasn\u2019t done. She also organized an ambitious conference for female poppers, funded through a Mary Gates Leadership Scholarship. \u201cI thought, \u2018What if I had all my idols in one space?\u2019\u201d recalls Langley. \u201cSo it started with a selfish idea, but also the desire to celebrate women and hip hop.\u201d Other female poppers, feeling the same isolation, came from as far away as Japan to attend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The conference, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/whatspoppinladiez\/\"><span class=\"s2\">WHAT\u2019S POPPIN\u2019 LADIEZ!<\/span><\/a>?, began with master classes at the UW and workshops at a breakdance studio in Seattle\u2019s International District, all taught by visiting female poppers. \u201cThey each had different styles of popping,\u201d says Langley. \u201cI\u2019d never had any female popping mentors, so that was something I wanted to see.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The conference continued with an event at Moksha, where female poppers performed choreographed showcase versions of their dance styles. Then came a battle featuring the poppers,\u00a0two female DJs, a female MC, and an all-female judging panel. Unlike a showcase event, battles are improvisational, with dancers responding to whatever music is playing at the time.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cAt most battles of poppers, the DJ, the judges, all my competitors, they\u2019re all guys,\u201d says Langley. \u201cI felt like the only way to call out my community in a healthy way was to organize a counter-event. I wanted to put Seattle on the map while also creating a platform for female poppers to share their own stories, experience, and skill through the exchange of dance.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Before the conference, Langley\u00a0\u2014 who goes by Moonyeka in the hip hop universe\u00a0\u2014 had connected with other female poppers through social media.\u00a0 But being in the same space for a battle was a completely different experience. \u201cOftentimes in the battle scene, I\u2019m the only female,\u201d says Langley. That\u2019s true for most of these women. They\u2019re often on solo journeys. Here we could be our whole selves, unapologetically. It was magical.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Juliet McMains, Langley\u2019s adviser for the project, agrees. \u201cI loved seeing the camaraderie, skill, creativity, ethnic diversity, and such a strong showing of women,\"\u00a0says McMains, associate professor of dance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Langley\u2019s one regret? The timing. \u201cIf I could go back, I\u2019d never tell myself to organize something like this while I was in school <i>and <\/i>working,\u201d she groans. Langley teaches at several Seattle dance studios, and will continue to teach after she graduates this fall. She also dances with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aucollective.com\/home.html\"><span class=\"s2\">Au Collective<\/span><\/a>, a Seattle dance company that puts people of color, queer people, and women at the forefront of its work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Looking back on the May event, Langley says, \u201cIt\u2019s like utopia happened and now it\u2019s gone again.\u201d But that just motivates her to introduce more Seattle women to popping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThere are just a few of us female poppers, and we\u2019re all working hard, and we\u2019re all alone in a way,\u201d says Langley. \u201cA lot of female poppers are moving to L.A., but I plan to stay in Seattle.

But this year, fifth grade teacher Pam Muncey has them all beat. In late July, at a remote site in Montana, she helped excavate a <a href=\"http:\/\/animals.nationalgeographic.com\/animals\/prehistoric\/tyrannosaurus-rex\/\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>Tyrannosaurus rex<\/i> <\/span><\/a>fossil.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI touched dinosaur bones that were 66 million years old!\u201d exclaims Muncey (BA, English, 1981; TEPFO,1985), a teacher at South Whidbey Elementary in Langley, Washington. \u201cHow do you even imagine something that magical and mind-blowing? It still makes me shiver.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Muncey was among the 35 K-12 teachers from across the country enrolled in the Burke Museum\u2019s<a href=\"http:\/\/digfieldschool.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\"> DIG (Discoveries in Geosciences) Field School<\/span><\/a>, a professional development program that introduces teachers to the basics of paleontology and immerses them in scientific methods. The year-round program includes a four-day field experience in northeastern Montana, where the teachers get their hands dirty\u00a0\u2014 literally\u00a0\u2014 working alongside researchers at an excavation site in Hell Creek State Park. The site is famous for its wealth of fossils from the Cretaceous period, when triceratops and <i>T. rex<\/i> roamed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">UW professor Greg Wilson began working at the site years ago as a graduate student, and it remains his favorite research setting. He founded the DIG Field School there in 2009 with then graduate student Lauren Berg DeBey (PhD, Biology, 2015). \u201cThe idea from the beginning was to give teachers an authentic experience by involving them in whatever we were working on,\u201d says Wilson, associate professor of biology and adjunct curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Burke Museum. \u201cOne of the most important things we can give them is a perspective on the process of science and what we actually do, rather than some manufactured experiences that we\u2019d never actually have as scientists.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The program started small but grew quickly after <a href=\"http:\/\/www.burkemuseum.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Burke Museum <\/span><\/a>board member John Pohl became involved. Pohl, a paleontology enthusiast, had an interest in science education for teachers and was excited by DIG Field School\u2019s immersive approach. \u00a0He encouraged Wilson and DeBey to expand the program, providing financial support and helping secure other funding, including sponsorship from Chevron Corporation. Pohl also attended the field school in 2011 with his daughter, a sixth grade science teacher.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI was like a kid in a candy store,\u201d Pohl says. \u201cWithin minutes of being in the field I picked up a bone fragment \u2014 the remains of a frill from a triceratops! But I did not get to simply ask, \u2018What is this?\u2019\u00a0 I had to think through what it looked like, where I was, what layer of earth I had found it in. And I could see the teachers around me rapidly grasping the research methods. It was easy to see how this would translate back to the classroom and how they would become better teachers as a result.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While some teachers who attend the program are fossil hounds like Pohl, many arrive in Montana with no field experience. On the first day, the staff orients the teachers to the area\u2019s geology, the Cretaceous period, methods for geological observation, and the tools they\u2019ll be using. The next day the teachers assist researchers at an active excavation site. On day three they work on independent research projects in groups, presenting their findings to their peers and the staff that evening. The final day is spent discussing how to bring some of the lessons and excitement of the field back to their classrooms.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI went into this project knowing very little about paleontology and feeling uncomfortable outside my comfort zone,\u201d says Sarah Coulson, a fifth grade teacher from Lacey, Washington. \u201cThis reminded me of how my students feel every time I ask them to try something new. The instructors were amazing, patient, and took time to make sure that we were all ready for the next step. It was a little intimidating presenting information to the experts, but by the time we got to the end of the week, we were ready.\u201d The instructors include knowledgeable UW faculty, graduate students, undergrads, and alumni, most of whom volunteer their time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The teachers experience both the highs and lows of a paleontology career in four days. The work is physical, in the middle of nowhere, in oppressive heat, often with nothing to show for the effort. \u201cTwo hours of not finding anything feels like a really long time in those conditions,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cSince the teachers had some of those lower moments, it was really fun to also give them the highest high.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Wilson is of course referring to the <i>T. rex<\/i> excavation on the second day. Before the teachers arrived, the crew had been working at the site for about three weeks and had unearthed the back of a <i>T. rex<\/i> skull and several ribs. The teachers excavated with the crew in search of more bones, and detailed the layers of earth to better understand when the <i>T. rex<\/i> died and how it was buried.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s really hard not to get a little bit geeked about <i>T. rex<\/i>,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cTo see the scale of it, it\u2019s just over-the-top impressive. I think the teachers were all completely beside themselves, and they sensed that the instructors were just as excited. They sensed that they were part of something really cool.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The day after the teachers\u2019 visit, the crew uncovered the rest of the <i>T. rex<\/i> skull and realized they had a beautifully preserved specimen. The discovery became international news. Wilson told the teachers and instructors about the skull around the campfire that night. \u201cThey erupted,\u201d says Wilson, \u201cand the rest of the evening and next day was filled with a buzz of excitement and being part of something remarkable.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The best part is that the teachers now get to share that experience with their students, year after year, making science relatable through their personal stories and photos. Burke DIG boxes and curriculum materials provide additional content, including the opportunity for K-12 students to examine actual sediment from the Montana site in search of smaller fossils.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe send a fresh bag of Montana real estate to the classroom so that teachers can share that experience of discovery with their students,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cThe students examine the sediment using a microscope or some other form of magnification, and if they find any small fossils, they can identify them using a guidebook we provide. It gives them a sense of participating in the research, it connects them with the Burke, and they get the sense of discovery.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Still, nothing quite compares to unearthing an intact <i>T. rex<\/i>. After returning from Montana, Muncey was so excited by the discovery that she sent news links about it to everyone she knew.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI have been stopped in the grocery story many times and asked, \u2019Were you really there?\u2019\u201d says Muncey. \u201cI think I am kind of famous right now.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>For more about DIG Field School, visit <\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/artsci.washington.edu\/M%3A\/WINWORD\/PERSP\/digfieldschool.org\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>digfieldschool.org<\/i><\/span><\/a><i>.

The paper, published Sept. 14 in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.the-cryosphere.net\/\"><span class=\"s2\">The Cryosphere<\/span><\/a>, is the first to quantify the sea ice changes in each polar bear subpopulation across the entire Arctic region using metrics that are specifically relevant to polar bear biology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThis study shows declining sea ice for all subpopulations of polar bears,\u201d said co-author\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/psc.apl.uw.edu\/people\/investigators\/harry-stern\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Harry Stern<\/span><\/a>, a researcher with the UW\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/psc.apl.uw.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Polar Science Center<\/span><\/a>. \u201cWe have used the same metric across all of the polar bear subpopulations in the Arctic so we can compare and contrast, for example, the Hudson Bay region with the Baffin Bay region using the same metric.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The analysis shows that the critical timing of the sea ice break-up and sea ice freeze-up is changing in all areas in a direction that is harmful for polar bears.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Nineteen separate polar bear populations live throughout the Arctic, spending their winters and springs roaming on sea ice and hunting. The bears have evolved mainly to eat seals, which provide necessary fats and nutrients in the harsh Arctic environment. Polar bears can\u2019t outswim their prey, so instead they perch on the ice as a platform and ambush seals at breathing holes or break through the ice to access their dens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cSea ice really is their platform for life,\u201d said co-author <a href=\"http:\/\/staff.washington.edu\/klaidre\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Kristin Laidre<\/span><\/a>, a researcher at the UW\u2019s Polar Science Center. \u201cThey are capable of existing on land for part of the year, but the sea ice is where they obtain their main prey.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The new study draws upon 35 years of satellite data showing sea ice concentration each day in the Arctic. NASA scientists process the data, stored at the <a href=\"http:\/\/nsidc.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\">National Snow and Ice Data Center<\/span><\/a> in Boulder, Colorado.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The center also <a href=\"http:\/\/nsidc.org\/arcticseaicenews\/2016\/09\/arctic-sea-ice-nears-its-minimum-extent-for-the-year\/\"><span class=\"s2\">reports each fall<\/span><\/a> the yearly minimum low for Arctic sea ice. This August saw the fourth lowest in the satellite record.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Across all 19 polar bear populations, the researchers found that the total number of ice-covered days declined at the rate of seven to 19 days per decade between 1979 and 2014. Sea ice concentration during the summer months \u2014 an important measure because summertime is when some subpopulations are forced to fast on land \u2014 also declined in all regions, by 1 percent to 9 percent per decade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The most striking result, researchers said, is the consistent trend across all polar bear regions for an earlier spring ice melt and a later fall freeze-up. Arctic sea ice retreats in the springtime as daylight reappears and temperatures warm. In the fall months the ice sheets build again as temperatures drop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThese spring and fall transitions bound the period when there is good ice habitat available for bears to feed,\u201d Laidre said. \u201cThose periods are also tied to the breeding season when bears find mates, and when females come out of their maternity dens with very small cubs and haven\u2019t eaten for months.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The researchers found that on average, spring melting was three to nine days earlier per decade, and fall freeze-up was three to nine days later per decade. That corresponds to a roughly 3 \u00bd week shift at either end \u2014 and seven weeks of total loss of good sea ice habitat for polar bears \u2014 over the 35 years of Arctic sea ice data.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe expect that if the trends continue, compared with today, polar bears will experience another six to seven weeks of ice-free periods by mid-century,\u201d Stern said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The trend appears to be linear and isn\u2019t accelerating or leveling off, Stern added. The researchers recommend that the <a href=\"http:\/\/nca2014.globalchange.gov\/\"><span class=\"s2\">National Climate Assessment<\/span><\/a> incorporate the timing of spring ice retreat and fall ice advance as measures of climate change in future reports.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The study\u2019s results currently are used by the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s<a href=\"http:\/\/pbsg.npolar.no\/en\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Polar Bear Specialist Group<\/span><\/a>, which completes assessments of polar bears and issues the species\u2019 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iucnredlist.org\/details\/22823\/0\"><span class=\"s2\">conservation status<\/span><\/a>.

UW faculty will select 15 to 20 of these projects as subjects for classes in a variety of disciplines. Students will work on the projects in conjunction with Auburn staff for a meaningful end result. Projects were identified over a wide range of topics, such as public works, innovation and technology, urban planning and more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThis program provides students with an opportunity to tackle meaningful and challenging real-world problems,\u201d Otten said. \u201cProjects addressed in these UW class and city collaborations directly affect the health and well-being of the city\u2019s population.

Their system requires no specialized equipment, relying solely on mobile devices commonly found with users to generate Wi-Fi signals using 10,000 times less energy than conventional methods.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cInstead of generating Wi-Fi signals on your own, our technology creates Wi-Fi by using Bluetooth transmissions from nearby mobile devices such as smartwatches,\u201d said co-author\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/faculty.washington.edu\/vamsit\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Vamsi Talla<\/span><\/a>, a recent UW doctoral graduate in electrical engineering who is now a research associate in the Department of Computer Science &amp; Engineering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The team\u2019s process relies on a communication technique called backscatter, which allows devices to exchange information simply by reflecting existing signals. Because the new technique enables inter-technology communication by using Bluetooth signals to create Wi-Fi transmissions, the team calls it \u201cinterscattering.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Interscatter communication uses the Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ZigBee\"><span class=\"s2\">ZigBee<\/span><\/a> radios embedded in common mobile devices\u00a0 like smartphones, watches, laptops, tablets and headsets, to serve as both sources and receivers for these reflected signals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In one example the team demonstrated, a smartwatch transmits a Bluetooth signal to a smart contact lens outfitted with an antenna. To create a blank slate on which new information can be written, the UW team developed an innovative way to transform the Bluetooth transmission into a \u201csingle tone\u201d signal that can be further manipulated and transformed. By backscattering that single tone signal, the contact lens can encode data \u2014 such as health information it may be collecting \u2014 into a standard Wi-Fi packet that can then be read by a smartphone, tablet or laptop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cBluetooth devices randomize data transmissions using a process called scrambling,\u201d said lead faculty <a href=\"https:\/\/homes.cs.washington.edu\/~gshyam\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Shyam Gollakota<\/span><\/a>, assistant professor of computer science and engineering. \u201cWe figured out a way to reverse engineer this scrambling process to send out a single tone signal from Bluetooth-enabled devices such as smartphones and watches using a software app.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The challenge, however, is that the backscattering process creates an unwanted mirror image copy of the signal, which consumes more bandwidth as well as interferes with networks on the mirror copy Wi-Fi channel.

They are working on a way to remove bacteria from water, using the campus wetlands as their test site.\n\nUnder the guidance of Rob Turner, senior lecturer in the School of Interdisciplinary Arts &amp; Sciences, Kellen Maloney, David Jackson and Saiwa Conejo believe that enzymes created by mushrooms' mass of tiny root-like mycelium destroy bacteria, such as E. coli.\n\nRoosting crows get some of the blame in the wetlands, but E. coli bacteria are a common problem in any waterway polluted by wastes from wild animals, cows or failed septic systems.\n\nThe burlap mats look like the booms or tubular wattles commonly used at construction sites to slow or catch sediment in runoff. The idea is to seed them with mushrooms and then put the fungi mats in parts of the 58-acre wetlands to filter water before it reaches North Creek, eliminating the fecal bacteria.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The team has been measuring how long the water needs to be in contact with the mats to kill E. coli. In one test, pouring wetland stream water through a mushroom sawdust medium reduced E. coli by 50 percent. Keeping it in contact for an hour increased that to 67 percent. And 24-hour contact removed 99.97 percent of the E.coli bacteria.\n\nThe researchers are so engaged in their progress they\u2019re volunteering their time this summer \u2013 unpaid and for no college credit. Of course, they believe it will pay off in the long run in their professional development. It\u2019s also exciting to work on something with the potential to help solve water pollution problems beyond Bothell.\n\nMaloney, who won a $750 Founders Fellow research scholarship in January, graduated in June in environmental science. He finds time to return to campus despite a full-time job. Jackson is working to graduate next June in environmental studies and is thinking of graduate school. Conejo wasn\u2019t sure of her major until she became involved in the project and is working to graduate in 2018 in environmental science.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in the environment, but this narrowed my focus,\u201d she says.\n\nJackson became hooked on the research after a spring quarter project.\n\n\u201cThat experiment was challenging enough and frustrating enough for me that I loved the fact that I was doing it,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen summer came and we all sat down and decided what we were doing I decided, this is it. I decided to stick with it \u2013 too much fun.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Maloney feels the excitement of discovery.\n\n\u201cFor me it\u2019s a lot like exploring \u2013 new knowledge,\u201d he says. \u201cTo understand that knowledge that\u2019s on our own earth, in our natural environment, is something I\u2019m really passionate about.\u201d\n\nTurner says his students have been conducting the research mostly on their own and don\u2019t need much guidance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate way to grow as a scholar and a researcher and in some ways better than if it was my grant project and I had it all figured out and said do this and do that,\u201d Turner says. The researchers credit Turner with great feedback on their ideas.\n\nTurner was recently informed that a grant proposal has been recommended for funding by the King County Wastewater Treatment Division. They too are interested to learn if fungi mats placed in enough ditches and streams could significantly reduce the bacterial pollution running into Lake Washington and Puget Sound.\n\nThe research demonstrates how the University wetlands are being used as a living laboratory with regional impact. It\u2019s also an example of collaboration between faculty, students and the Facilities and Campus Operations staff who maintain the wetlands. And, it gives students real-world experience.\n\n\u201cIn terms of grad school acceptance and jobs in the environmental field these kind of research experiences and the connections you make really help you make that next career step \u2013 much more than getting good grades or the kinds of courses you take,\u201d Turner said. \u201cBeyond that it\u2019s intellectually stimulating and fun.\u201d\n\nThe research was started by Turner and student Phil Van Valkenburg (environmental studies \u201915), based on the work of Paul Stamets, a mycologist and author in Olympia who advocates using mushrooms for bioremediation. The particular mushroom used in this bioremediation is the blue oyster. So, the work starts with blue oyster cultivation. The mushrooms that sprout are edible, Turner says, though a steady diet of fecal coliform bacteria doesn\u2019t add to their culinary appeal.\n\nThe fungi mats are ready, but the weather is dry. Field testing will start when fall rains increase the water flowing from the wetlands into North Creek. Sampling will show how effectively the mats reduce bacteria. For now, the focus is on the lab experiments to reveal the antimicrobial power of the mushrooms and how best to deploy the inoculated wattles.\n\nThe researchers hope their fungi mats could become a best management practice for mitigating bacteria pollution in runoff.\n\n\u201cI think in the long run it\u2019s worth it. What we\u2019re doing will make a difference and will be implemented on a grand scale,\u201d Conejo said.<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Preserving the past, helping the future","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/preserving-the-past-helping-the-future\/","tags":["alumni","arts-sciences","college-of-the-environment","faculty"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"Join us as we go behind-the-scenes at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture.

You\u2019ve read countless studies, but words can only take you so far: You want to see the change for yourself. This is where the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture comes in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition to connecting the public with the past, the museum\u2019s 16 million specimens \u2014 housed at the museum and offsite facilities \u2014 serve as a living encyclopedia for researchers. Want to learn how Alaska Native communities wove intricate baskets 200 years ago? Interested in seeing how birds adapted to warming temperatures? Find it all \u2014 and more \u2014 at the Burke.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Scroll through our photo essay to get a glimpse of the museum\u2019s many wonders, and learn the fascinating stories behind a few items.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Mammalogy<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With more than 50,000 specimens, the Burke mammal collection is among the largest in the nation. Its cabinets are stuffed with rows and rows of almost every mammal you can think of. A drawer of porcupines sits in the center of the room near a whale skeleton, while a taxidermied beaver looks down on a lion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">With a wealth of specimens at the ready, the collection enables researchers in a variety of fields to learn about and compare species. Most importantly, emphasizes Collections Manager Jeff Bradley, the animals will help answer future questions about our changing world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Mount St. Helens mammals<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">On May 18, 1980, the ground shook. The skies over the Pacific Northwest grew dark, and thick ash came down for hours. Mount St. Helens, a volcano in southeastern Washington, was erupting. It was the most deadly and economically destructive volcanic event in U.S. history, and it completely devastated the surrounding natural area, home to many species of plants and animals. The eruption created a great natural experiment: How does nature recover from such devastation? And, more specifically, how long would it take animals to return?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Researchers saw many species return as soon as two years after the eruption, and by 2014, 19 species they expected to return had done so. The collection of Mount St. Helens rodents also enabled researchers to track the gradual return of fungi\u00a0species, evident through the rodents\u2019 diets.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Paleontology<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">More than 64,000 specimens of fossil dinosaurs, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fishes make up the Vertebrate Paleontology Collection, including the first dinosaur fossil ever found in Washington state.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Throughout the long process of getting fossils from the field to the museum floor, much work is actually done by dedicated volunteers. At the Burke, volunteers are instrumental in the preparation of fossils, which entails hours of careful scraping to remove specimens from the rocks they\u2019re encased in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Triceratops<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Twenty-five feet long, nearly 10 feet tall and weighing close to 26,000 lbs., Triceratops roamed \u2014 or, rather, bulldozed its way across \u2014 North America about 68 million years ago. With its characteristic horns and frill, Triceratops is one of the most recognizable dinosaurs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This Triceratops fossil, part of the massive frill, was discovered at the Hell Creek Formation in northeastern Montana by Burke researchers. Hell Creek boasts an international reputation as a fossil treasure trove; in fact, the first Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton was found in the area in 1902. Today, Greg Wilson, adjunct curator of vertebrate paleontology, brings students and faculty to the site for annual digs, with new discoveries unearthed each summer.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Culture<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Burke Museum\u2019s Culture Department (which includes archaeological and ethnological collections) cares for over one million objects of culture heritage, primarily from the Americas, Oceania and Asia. In addition to housing the objects, the museum works closely with American Indian and Alaska Native and Pacific Islander communities to help people engage with the objects of their ancestors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Heritage<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">On the day of our visit to the collection, women from Eastern Washington tribes \u2014 including the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation and the Spokane Tribe \u2014 were gathered around a large table in the back of the museum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Examining a buckskin tunic, beaded bag and a pair of leggings (dated to the late 1800\u2019s), the women laughed and shared family stories as they worked. One of the women pointed out that an item might have been from her tribe, since her great-grandmother possessed an item with a similar pattern. And as modern weavers, sewers and beaders, the delicate craftsmanship of the originals provides tremendous inspiration.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"p5\">Ichthyology<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Down by the Montlake Cut, the Burke Museum\u2019s Ichthyology Collection houses one of the largest fish and larval fish collections in the world, including more than eight million individual larval fish. It\u2019s known as a regional collection, featuring about 4,100 species (\u201cEverything you\u2019d expect to see,\u201d says Collections Manager Katherine Maslenikov) from the North Pacific, Bering Sea and Pacific Northwest freshwater sources.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Otoliths<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Have you ever wondered how fish swimming in the dark depths of the ocean know which way is up? It\u2019s thanks to these small inner-ear bones, called otoliths. \u201cThe otolith floats in a chamber of liquid, and doesn\u2019t move in the same direction as the bones in a fish\u2019s head surrounding the chamber,\u201d explains Maslenikov. \u201cFish sense the position of the otolith, which tells them their position in the water.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Much like trees, otoliths have growth rings researchers can count to determine a fish\u2019s age. New technology also allows researchers to analyze otoliths for the chemical signature of the water the fish was swimming through in each year of its life, which opens endless possibilities for studying climate change and ocean acidification.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"p2\">Herbarium<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Walking through the rows and rows of plant collections at the University of Washington Herbarium is like walking through the best of the Pacific Northwest: The sweet smells of dried grasses, lavender, mint, and pine mingle in the air as cabinets are opened in succession.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">About 700,000 specimens of vascular (e.g. flowering plants), non-vascular (e.g. aquatic plants, mosses), lichens, fungi and marine algae document the diversity of plant life in the Pacific Northwest. In fact, the Herbarium features the largest collection of PNW plants in the world. And each year, more species are discovered and added to the best-smelling library you\u2019ll ever visit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Trevor Kincaid<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The Herbarium traces its roots all the way back to the beginnings of the Burke: Museum founder Trevor Kincaid was an avid plant collector. Kincaid was part of the Young Naturalists Society, whose members included Edmond Meany and Charles Denny, son of Seattle founder Arthur Denny. In 1885, the group raised funds for a small building on the UW\u2019s original campus in downtown Seattle to house their collection, which eventually evolved into the Burke Museum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Kincaid earned his bachelor\u2019s degree from the UW in 1899, and after receiving his master\u2019s, he joined the UW faculty as a biology professor. Throughout his life, Kincaid identified and named of hundreds of species \u2014 even as an undergraduate. He extended his love of the outdoors to his students, and founded the UW\u2019s Friday Harbor Laboratories in the early 1900\u2019s so they could experience the rich biodiversity of the San Juan Islands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">--<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With the opening of the New Burke Museum in 2019 \u2014 with a 66 percent larger facility \u2014visitors will get a closer look at many of these collections thanks to an inside-out view of preservation processes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Learn more about these collections and others at <a href=\"http:\/\/burkemuseum.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\">burkemuseum.org<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Worm tale","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/worm-tale\/","tags":["faculty","tacoma"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subhead field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<div class=\"field-items\">\n<div class=\"field-item even\">In a matter of minutes UW Tacoma's Dr. Megan Schwartz discovered a new species and bumped into UW President Ana Mari Cauce.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><\/div>","content":"(UW Tacoma, August 2016)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You never know what the tide will bring in: new species, or even the occasional UW President. Dr. Megan Schwartz has surveyed False Bay for 18 years, and on a recent trip with students, she made the discovery of a new species of\u00a0<i>nemertean<\/i>, or as they are more commonly known, ribbon worms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Schwartz discovered the worm with her students during the lowest tide of the year at False Bay, one of the San Juan Island Marine Preserves, located just off shore from UW\u2019s<a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/fhl\/\"><span class=\"s2\"> Friday Harbor Laboratories<\/span><\/a>. She was approached soon after by another curious mind, UW President Ana Mari Cauce. Although she was there by pure coincidence, Cauce was incredibly eager to learn about Schwartz\u2019s new finding and proceeded to take a picture of Schwartz with the worm, which promptly became her new Facebook profile picture.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are over 1,000 known species of ribbon worm all over the planet, and many more as yet undiscovered. They vary in size, length, and color but the major commonality between them is their unique organ, the proboscis, located at the anterior end of their bodies, which captures and paralyzes their prey. Most ribbon worms are smaller than 10 centimeters, while some are as long as 60 meters. Schwartz laughed and explained, \"If you really love a worm you'll cut it up into 17 different pieces and put it into 17 different fixatives so that you can understand it in 17 different ways,\" because, largely, they remain understudied.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You might wonder why someone would devote 22 years of her life to worms. \"I thought I was going to be an MD and I took vertebrate anatomy,\u201d said Schwartz. She thought, \u201cthat's an interesting way to be an animal, you have vertebrae and these two floppy appendages in the front and in the back (arms and legs), that's pretty much the pattern for vertebrates.\" After taking a course in invertebrate zoology at a marine lab, Schwartz found she was even more fascinated by the myriad forms of animals without spines, and thus pursued a career as an invertebrate zoologist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Schwartz grew up in downtown Chicago, always fascinated by biology, but the most obvious species around were pigeons and rats. She earned her undergraduate degree in biology from Bryn Mawr College, after which she attended Wake Forest University for her Master's degree. After moving to the Puget Sound area with her husband 13 years ago she earned her Ph.D. from George Washington University.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A large focus of her research is marine biodiversity. Schwartz describes it thusly: \u201cLike dandelion seeds travel in the wind, larvae travel in the water.\u201d Species of nemerteans can be traced across the globe, a path she has followed personally. If a nemertean can be found there, she likely will be too. Her research has even taken her to Antarctica, where she found a species that she later realized had excreted acid onto her hand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Documenting these species is crucial because they may not be around forever. If you don\u2019t know a species exists, she asks, \u201cHow can you care for and protect it?\u201d Understanding the natural history of the world around us provides context, not just for human life, but for the plethora of other living things around us. Schwartz integrates the work of late UW zoologist<a href=\"http:\/\/www.biology.washington.edu\/news\/prof-emeritus-bob-paine-1933-2016\"><span class=\"s2\"> Robert T. Paine<\/span><\/a>, who is best known for his theorization of keystone species, crucial species in an ecosystem upon which other species rely. Schwartz theorizes that nemerteans may be keystone species in many habitats, making their documentation a high priority.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In total Schwartz has discovered nearly 80 species of nemertean, with 10 currently <a href=\"http:\/\/digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu\/ias_pub\/261\"><span class=\"s2\">documented<\/span><\/a>, and two awaiting documentation, including the worm discovered with President Cauce. As she continues her research she looks to Papua New Guinea and Ecuador for their cloud rainforests, where even hundreds of feet up in the trees terrestrial nemerteans can be found.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Reflecting on her feelings at the moment she realizes a find is actually a new species, Schwartz says, \u201cDiscovering new species is what keeps me moving forward. It's like the best rollercoaster ever really\u2014finding something no one ever knew about.\u201d<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"The brain, by the numbers","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/the-brain-by-the-numbers\/","tags":["arts-sciences","faculty","medicine"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"Bing Brunton searches for meaningful patterns in data from electrical signals in the brain.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, August 2016)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There\u2019s a whole world between your ears. And neuroscientist Bing Brunton, assistant professor of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biology.washington.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">biology<\/span><\/a>, would like to visit it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brunton likens the complexity of the human brain to a bustling world, complicated at every level. Each neuron in the brain\u00a0\u2014 and there are billions\u00a0\u2014 contains thousands of connections that function like little cities, with infrastructure and energy factories and workers and highways to deliver supplies and remove refuse. \u201cAnd that\u2019s just a tiny part of the brain,\u201d says Brunton. \u201cWhen we start zooming out, there is an enormous gallery of different types of neurons, and then layers of organization, and different areas of the brain with different functions.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To study such a complex organ, Brunton believes that quantitative methods\u00a0\u2014 analyzing data from brain activity\u00a0\u2014 is the best approach. \u201cWe have 86 million neurons in the brain, and every single one of them talks to approximately 1,000 other ones,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re working with a system that complicated, you need a mathematical understanding. I\u2019ve always been drawn to quantitative techniques, quantitative explanations for things.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brunton explains that brain cells talk to each other using electrical signals\u00a0\u2014 the same electricity that powers a computer or radio. The way we experience the world, produce sensations, reason, and experience emotion are all based on those signals. And just as a car antenna picks up radio signals, wires placed in the brain can measure and record electrical activity from nearby neurons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With recent advances in technology, scientists are able to record and measure signals from many brain cells simultaneously, more quickly and for longer periods than ever before. The challenge is to find meaningful patterns in the recorded data that might help explain how our brains process information, make decisions, and execute tasks from walking to speaking. Traditional mathematical techniques don\u2019t scale well for such large data sets, so what\u2019s needed are new methods. That\u2019s where Brunton comes in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThis is a really interesting opportunity for developing new computational and mathematical methods to understand the giant pile of data we have,\u201d says Brunton, a member of the <a href=\"http:\/\/uwin.washington.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">UW Institute for Neuroengineering<\/span><\/a> and a data-science fellow with the UW <a href=\"http:\/\/escience.washington.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">eScience Institute<\/span><\/a>. \u201cThis has happened over and over in the physical sciences\u00a0\u2014 people observe some new phenomenon and they have to invent new mathematics in order to explain it. Newton did that to some extent. He figured out gravitation and had to invent calculus to deal with it. That is starting to happen in biology, and I feel like understanding the complexity of the brain might demand something like that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Much of Brunton\u2019s data comes from collaborators at UW Medicine. They record electrical activity during\u00a0neurosurgeries for clinical purposes, but then share the data with Brunton with permission from patients. Brunton also uses data from animal research, most recently working with Department of Biology colleagues who study subtleties of insect flight. They now record brain activity in addition to other functions as the insects fly. \u201cTheir brains are much, much simpler, so we focus on things that are relevant to that organism,\u201d says Brunton. \u201cWe look at how they fly so well and how they respond to aerodynamic forces.\u201d Brunton\u2019s research is funded by the Washington Research Foundation, the Alfred P.

A Parkinson\u2019s patient opts for deep brain stimulation (DBS) to reduce symptoms. A college student uses close-looped DBS to keep severe depression at bay. Through neuroscience research and neural engineering, the brain can now accomplish things once considered impossible. But with these advances come ethical questions about altering brain function. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhen we implant electrodes into brains for therapeutic reasons, all of a sudden you may be stimulating regions of the brain, and that means we\u2019re controlling regions of the brain,\u201d says Tom Daniel, professor of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biology.washington.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">biology<\/span><\/a> and Joan and Richard Komen Endowed Chair. Daniel is a researcher at the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.csne-erc.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering<\/span><\/a>, a National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded Engineering Research Center that designs implantable devices that interact seamlessly with the nervous system. \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As soon as the Center received NSF funding, Daniel reached out to the <a href=\"https:\/\/phil.washington.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Department of Philosophy<\/span><\/a> to bring a neuroethicist on board. \u201cIt\u2019s always great for scientists to come to us rather than being told they need to do it,\u201d says Sara Goering, professor of philosophy, who specializes in disability ethics and bioethics. \u201cThey realized really early on that there would be interesting and tough ethical issues about the technology. I commend them for having figured that out so early.\u201d In fact, the Center\u2019s original proposal to NSF included funding for ethics support.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The collaboration began with Goering and several philosophy graduate students doing a literature review of neuroethics research, then interviewing all of the Center\u2019s principal investigators about their research. They asked the scientists what ethical issues might arise in their work, then pointed out additional issues that some of the scientists hadn\u2019t considered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Neuroscience raises a wide range of ethical concerns. One is agency, or ownership of our actions. If a neural device is stimulating the brain while someone decides on an action, is that person still the author of that action? Is accountability complicated by the device? Privacy is also an issue. Could a wireless neural device be hacked, with confidential neurological data compromised? Could someone hijack a device and control the user\u2019s brain signals?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although that last scenario is highly unlikely, other ethical considerations come up often, such as how a device might change the user\u2019s sense of self. Understanding the perspectives of people with disabilities\u00a0\u2014 likely early users of neural devices\u00a0\u2014 is essential. The neuroethics team has run focus groups with people with disabilities to better understand their thoughts and concerns.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cPeople may want normal function, but not at any cost,\u201d says Goering. \u201cThey might prefer to use a wheelchair rather than put on a clunky exoskeleton to get up and walk again. And some people don\u2019t <i>want<\/i> normal function. Some of our work is making those perspectives known, so that researchers are sensitive to them as they think about their work.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Over time, the philosophers\u2019 involvement with the Center has grown. Eran Klein, a practicing neurologist with a PhD in philosophy, now joins the ethics team one day a week. He recently co-authored a paper about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csne-erc.org\/engage-enable\/post\/informed-consent-implantable-brain-computer-interface-research\"><span class=\"s2\">informed consent considerations<\/span><\/a> for human subjects in implantable brain-computer interface research. NSF also added funding for a full-time postdoctoral philosopher at the Center, and the team includes a full-time philosophy research assistant and three neuroethics fellows, with a fourth fellow at MIT who Skypes into team meetings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The best part? Scientists at the Center now seek the ethics team\u2019s expertise as a matter of course. Goering recalls a recent email from a neuroengineering graduate student who wanted to explore potential ethical considerations before submitting a research proposal for a new project. \u201cThat\u2019s how the conversation begins,\u201d says Goering. \u201cWe\u2019ve been at the Center so long now and built this relationship where people are ready to ask these questions as they are designing their projects, which is great.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While neuroengineering does raise ethical issues, Goering is also excited by its promise. Her team has recently been working with members of a national ethics workgroup linked to President Obama\u2019s Brain Initiative, established to support neuroscience research.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to be scared by the technology,\u201d Goering says. \u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating area to explore and one that potentially has great benefits for a lot of people. But because it is novel, we want to think carefully about what the consequences might be, especially because our brains are so intimately related to who we are. As neuroethicists, we always encourage those conversations.\u201d<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"A marriage of art & neuroscience","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/a-marriage-of-art-neuroscience\/","tags":["arts-sciences","faculty","graduate-student"],"pillars":["innovation","student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"DXARTS faculty and students find artistic inspiration in the tools of neuroscience.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, August 2016)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Students in a laboratory crowd around a classmate wearing an electroencephalography (EEG) cap.

Chemistry alumnus Donald Bergstrom (BS, 1965)\u00a0established the award in 2013.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThere are a lot of questions that are wide open with this neuroscience technology,\u201d says James Coupe (PhD, DXARTS, 2009), associate professor of DXARTS. \u201cIt\u2019s like the early days of photography or cinema, when people asked, \u2018What are the possibilities of this camera? What would make sense to film?\u2019 In the same way, we want to challenge ourselves and ask, \u2018What is the language of neuroscience and what is its value to art? What can we do with this?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">DXARTS explores that question in a 400-level course, Art and the Brain, taught by an interdisciplinary team that includes Coupe, DXARTS director Juan Pampin, UW physiology and biophysics professor Eberhard Fetz, and Thomas Deuel, a practicing neurologist at Swedish Hospital. Both Fetz and Deuel have an interest in art; Deuel studied jazz composition and performance at the New England Conservatory while completing an MD\/PhD in neurobiology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It was Fetz who first reached out to DXARTS about collaborating. He admired how <i>Sanctum<\/i>, a public art project that Coupe and Pampin created for the fa\u00e7ade of the Henry Art Gallery, melded art and technology. He wondered whether a similar melding might be possible with art and neuroscience. Discussions with Coupe led to the Art and the Brain course in 2013.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The first year of the course, the lab had not yet been established. Students learned the basic concepts and tools of neuroscience, then developed proposals for an art project that would incorporate the technology in a meaningful way. \u201cThe proposals were all speculative,\u201d says Coupe. \u201cWe tried to rein them in based on what was possible according to the neuroscientists in the room, but artists can get pretty carried away.\u201d In subsequent years, students have been able to realize their ideas in the Art and the Brain Lab\u00a0\u2014 or at least explore what\u2019s actually possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Throughout the quarter, the neuroscience experts talk about brain science and various devices that measure neural activity. The students then use the devices in the lab to complete four assignments, leading to a more ambitious final project. Coupe and Pampin provide guidance and critiques throughout to ensure that the technology never overshadows artistic intention.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI think it\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of just showing what this technology can do rather than doing something really interesting with it,\u201d says DXARTS graduate student Dan Peterson, who took the course in 2016. \u201cI try to stay away from having the artwork be about the technology.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Peterson and fellow DXARTS graduate student Adam Hogan collaborated on a final project that reflects their backgrounds in sound and filmmaking respectively.\u00a0 Using Peterson\u2019s existing field recordings and Hogan\u2019s existing film footage, they \u201cedited\u201d each other\u2019s work through their neural responses to it. The students, hooked up to EEG machines, were positioned to experience each other\u2019s work but not their own. As Hogan listened to the sound recordings, any sound that caused a spike in his brain activity prompted the film footage that Peterson was watching to jump to a different section. Conversely, when that film footage caused a spike in Peterson\u2019s brain activity, the sound recording would change.\u00a0 \u201cWith the back and forth, we made this kind of feedback loop and tried to see where it would take us,\u201d says Peterson.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Though the course has ended, Peterson and Hogan are continuing with their project. Neuroscience is essential to it, yet both artists feel that the work remains true to their long-standing creative interests. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s just another way to approach non-narrative filmmaking, which is what I\u2019m interested in,\u201d says Hogan. \u201cEvery time a new piece of technology is introduced, what\u2019s interesting is how to incorporate that tool within your existing practice.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What about students who don\u2019t have an existing art practice? Classmate Rachel Townsend, a museology graduate student, is not an artist. She took the course to explore how art affects the brain. For her final project, Townsend had subjects view nine famous artworks for one minute each as she gathered data about their viewing patterns using an eye movement tracker. She then explored ways to share those viewing patterns through video\u00a0\u2014 illuminating an artwork with points of light for each detail viewed, for example. \u201cThe class changed the way I thought about how an artist might gain inspiration from the ways our bodies function,\u201d says Townsend. \u201cIt also helped me think about the unique challenges museums face when working with digital artists.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While the Art and the Brain course is open to all UW students, it is required for DXARTS PhD students, reflecting DXARTS\u2019s emphasis on experimental media and taking risks. \u201cWe want our students to be familiar with these tools,\u201d says Pampin, \u201cand we believe that the discussions that come up in the course, the thinking about things in a different way, is quite important for them.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The course and lab have stretched the faculty as well. \u201cAs a teacher and artist, I feel like I\u2019m also a student in the class, because there\u2019s so much that nobody knows,\u201d says Coupe. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to look this stuff up. It\u2019s the brave new world of developing not just new media for art, but a new vocabulary. That\u2019s what's interesting about it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Siri, can I be more human?","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/siri-can-i-be-more-human\/","tags":["alumni","arts-sciences"],"pillars":["impact","student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"What does it take to prove that you are more human than a computer?

He wrote about the experience in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brian-christian.com\/the-most-human-human\/\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>The Most Human Human <\/i><\/span><\/a>(2011), a <i>Wall Street Journal <\/i>National Bestseller<i>, a New York Times <\/i>Editors' Choice, and a <i>New Yorker <\/i>Favorite Book of the Year. Christian also explores the relationship between humans and computers in his new book, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brian-christian.com\/algorithms-to-live-by\/\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>Algorithms to Live By <\/i><\/span><\/a>(2016), which uses computer science as a lens for understanding human decision-making.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Your undergraduate degrees are in computer science and philosophy. What led you to pursue a master\u2019s degree in creative writing?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I had always pursued those disciplines in parallel, going back at least as far as high school. Over the course of my undergraduate years, I began to wonder: having viewed computer science as my career and writing as my passion, what if it was the other way around? Even though I was (and remain) fascinated by both computer science and philosophy, it began to feel that in literature the stakes felt higher, and it was possible to make a more individual, unique contribution. By the end of college I was resolved to go headlong into literature and see where it took me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>When did you first hear about the Turing test and why were you so keen on participating?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As someone who had double-majored as an undergrad in computer science (the artificial intelligence track) and philosophy (the philosophy of mind track), it was one of the few things that explicitly came up in both departments. For me the Turing test had become something of a nexus of all three of my disciplinary interests: a test in the medium of written language, against a piece of software, for the highest philosophical stakes. As my nonfiction writing began to revolve around the test, as a kind of lightning rod for the questions I was dealing with about what technology can teach us about the human condition, I noticed that in the most recent contest, the leading computer program came up shy of \"passing the Turing test\" by just a single vote. There was a sense in the press that humanity had just dodged a bullet. The next contest was a year away, and the question was whether this would be the year the machines finally won. A voice inside me rose up: \"Not on my watch.\" And I reached out to the organizing committee, and crossed the line from observer to participant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>You did quite a bit of prepping for the test, to ensure that judges would rate you as more human than the computer. How does a human prep to be <i>more<\/i> human?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is in many ways the central question of the book. How <i>do<\/i> you try to \u201cact human\u201d in a competitive setting, one where you\u2019ll be judged \u2014 relative not only to machines but to other humans \u2014 on your success in doing so? It\u2019s a fascinating question, and a bizarre one. I spent weeks poring over the transcripts of previous Turing tests \u2014 800 pages worth, with a highlighter and a French press \u2014 looking at the cases where real humans failed, being judged to be machines, and the cases where the machines conversely succeeded in deceiving the judges. Meanwhile I learned all I could about the history and the design of chatbots [computer programs designed to simulate intelligent conversation] \u2014 their capacities, their limitations \u2014 and spent a lot of time probing them for weaknesses. And I talked to as many experts I could, across a broad swatch of fields \u2014 psychologists, linguists, computer scientists, philosophers \u2014 and put the question to them. What are the hallmarks that make human intelligence uniquely complex? How can I make sure to showcase these things? What would <i>you<\/i> do as a confederate in a Turing test? I tried to synthesize all of these different perspectives, and my research behind enemy lines into chatbots themselves, into a game plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>In studying transcripts from previous Turing tests, you observed that computers tend to just reply to the last comment or question asked rather than referencing earlier discussion points for context. One would think that would be an easy \u201ctell\u201d for the judges. Why isn\u2019t it?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In computer science, this is known as \u201cstatelessness,\u201d and in statistics it\u2019s called the \u201cMarkov property\u201d \u2014 a process whose next state depends <i>only<\/i> on the present state, and not on the entire history. As to why this isn\u2019t an obvious tell, I\u2019m reminded of the Oxford philosopher John Lucas: if and when computers pass the Turing test, it will be \u201cnot because machines are so intelligent, but because humans, many of them at least, are so wooden.\u201d The truth is that many Turing test failures are as a result of the low bar set by many human interactions. In fact, what I came to realize is that many human interactions <i>are<\/i> stateless. But by knowing to look out for it, we have a means of being better conversationalists and communicators in our own lives. This was one of the surprising results of the book for me: what began as an investigation into technology in many ways became an investigation into the nature of human conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Did your research for the Turing test change how you communicate?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Absolutely, and sometimes to a distracting extent. I strive for stateful conversations, for instance, where every remark depends upon the entire history of the interaction (or even of the relationship) to take on its full meaning. I think much more about the timing of turn-taking, interruption, and floor-yielding than I ever did, having realized in the course of my preparation that sometimes it\u2019s the <i>form<\/i>of an interaction, every bit as much as the <i>content<\/i>, where the true complexity lies. I try whenever possible to ask people questions in which I am less interested in <i>the<\/i> answer than in <i>their<\/i> answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>You admit to being surprisingly invested in the outcome of the test. You were quite relieved to be chosen as \u201cthe most human human\u201d \u2014 an honor bestowed on one of the four human participants. Why did it matter so much to you?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At some level, the test provokes a kind of existential anxiety: to fail to convey one\u2019s humanity is a more serious charge than to fail to sink a three-pointer, for instance. At another level, I was entering into the competition as a kind of a ringer: I had invested an enormous amount of time and effort, relative to my fellow confederates, into preparing for the role. So I suppose it would have been charmingly embarrassing to be bested, after all that, by folks \u201cjust being themselves.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Does your new book, <i>Algorithms to Live By<\/i>, pick up threads from the first book?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In many ways, <i>Algorithms to Live By<\/i> continues in the vein of <i>The Most Human Human<\/i>, although in some sense it also presents a kind of counter-thesis. <i>The Most Human Human<\/i> tells the story of what we've learned about ourselves from the differences between us and the machines we've built in our image. <i>Algorithms to Live By<\/i> looks at what we've learned about ourselves from the surprising things we share with machines. Many of the fundamental problems of human life strongly parallel some of the canonical problems in computer science, and so there's a genuine opportunity to learn something \u2014 both about how to make better decisions every day, but more broadly about the nature of human decision-making itself \u2014 by exploring these parallels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Some people believe humans won\u2019t be able to catch up again once computers beat them at the Turing test, because technological evolution seems to occur so much faster than biological evolution. Your response is, \u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t buy it.\u201d Can you elaborate?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So many of the man-machine challenges have the property that as soon as the machines win once, we retire the competition. Few people remember that Garry Kasparov <i>won<\/i> in his first series against Deep Blue, in 1996. He then lost the 1997 rematch series, after which point IBM of course had zero interest in a best-of-three match for all the marbles in 1998. Instead they declared victory and hastily dismantled the machine. The same thing happened with their Watson system in 2011. In the book I make the analogy of a boxing match in which one of the boxer\u2019s, but only one, has the power to ring the match-ending bell as soon as the scorecard favors them. Rather, my attitude is that this is the moment when things are just starting to get interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One of the hallmarks \u2014 if not <i>the<\/i> hallmark \u2014 of human intelligence is its ability to adapt. In the Turing test, especially, we hold mechanical imitations up against genuine human conversation, which is of course wildly varying in quality and caliber. A legitimate loss would I think be an incredibly compelling and fascinating opportunity for us <i>Homo sapiens <\/i>\u2014 to raise the level of the game.<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Decoding dyslexia","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/decoding-dyslexia\/","tags":["arts-sciences","faculty"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"Associate Professor Jason Yeatman's research may eventually lead to personalized intervention programs for dyslexia.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, August 2016)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Your brain is multitasking as you read this article.

Though <i>Homo sapiens<\/i> evolved specialized brain regions to communicate through language, evolution has not caught up with reading. \u201cIt is a made-up human invention, and it\u2019s only been around for a few thousand years,\u201d says Yeatman. \u201cWe teach our children this arbitrary system of printed symbols, and assign sounds to each symbol, and we use that to represent language in a totally new way. And their brains learn to do it really well most of the time. Understanding how the brain accomplishes this is fascinating. It requires the integration of many different kinds of brain functions. It\u2019s a model for how the brain learns to do all kinds of new things.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Thanks to recent advances in non-invasive brain imaging technology, Yeatman\u2019s research team at the I-LABS\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/bdelab\"><span class=\"s2\">Brain Development &amp; Education Lab<\/span><\/a> is able to study developing brains to identify changes as children acquire reading skills.

It\u2019s recognizing shapes on the page as letters, translating those letters into sounds and words, and ascribing meaning to them. For most people, the skill becomes automatic during grade school. But for people with dyslexia, reading takes effort.\u00a0 Jason Yeatman wants to understand why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yeatman, assistant professor of<a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/sphsc\/\"><span class=\"s2\">speech and hearing sciences<\/span><\/a> and a researcher with the <a href=\"http:\/\/ilabs.washington.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Institute for Learning &amp; Brain Sciences<\/span><\/a> (I-LABS), uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study the brain processes involved in reading, with a focus on dyslexia. \u201cYou can observe a child struggling to read, but looking at the structure and function of the brain opens up new understandings of why that is,\u201d says Yeatman, whose studies involve both children and adults.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Reading is a relatively new function for humans. Though <i>Homo sapiens<\/i> evolved specialized brain regions to communicate through language, evolution has not caught up with reading. \u201cIt is a made-up human invention, and it\u2019s only been around for a few thousand years,\u201d says Yeatman. \u201cWe teach our children this arbitrary system of printed symbols, and assign sounds to each symbol, and we use that to represent language in a totally new way. And their brains learn to do it really well most of the time. Understanding how the brain accomplishes this is fascinating. It requires the integration of many different kinds of brain functions. It\u2019s a model for how the brain learns to do all kinds of new things.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Thanks to recent advances in non-invasive brain imaging technology, Yeatman\u2019s research team at the I-LABS\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/bdelab\"><span class=\"s2\">Brain Development &amp; Education Lab<\/span><\/a> is able to study developing brains to identify changes as children acquire reading skills.

The machine works like a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/tests-procedures\/ct-scan\/basics\/definition\/prc-20014610\"><span class=\"s2\">standard CT scanner<\/span><\/a> used in hospitals: A series of X-ray images is taken from different angles, then combined using computer processing to create three-dimensional images of the skeleton.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The goal is to make it possible for scientists to examine the morphology of a particular species, or try to understand why a group of fish all have similar physical characteristics such as bony head \u201carmor\u201d or the ability to burrow into the sand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s been so fun to throw this data up on the web and have people actually use it,\u201d Summers said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Until now, there hasn\u2019t been an easy \u2014 or cheap \u2014 way for scientists to get detailed, three-dimensional scans of critters. Summers recalls having to beg hospitals to scan his specimens, including a sting ray that in 2000 was the first CT-scanned fish to appear on the cover of a biology journal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Over the years, Summers and colleagues have developed more efficient ways to scan specimens in larger batches at hospitals, but each scan was still very expensive \u2014 anywhere from $500 to $2,000 each.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Summers saw the need for an in-house scanner and raised $340,000 to purchase the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bruker.com\/products\/microtomography\/micro-ct-for-sample-scanning\/skyscan-1173\/overview.html\"><span class=\"s2\">machine<\/span><\/a> last November that now lives at Friday Harbor Laboratories. His policy is that it\u2019s free and open to anyone who wants to use it, and the fish must come from museum-accessioned collections.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Students, postdoctoral researchers and professors from around the world have taken Summers up on the offer and come to the labs on San Juan Island to scan their favorite specimens. They also send boxes of fish specimens in the mail for Summers\u2019 lab to scan and post online. Fish from museum collections are trackable with numbers, and the online database now houses scans of fish from the UW\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.burkemuseum.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture<\/span><\/a>, the National Academy of Sciences in Philadelphia, Ohio State University, Western Australian Museum and many others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe just make it a group effort to get everything done,\u201d Summers said. \u201cHaving this scanner has made it clear to me the incredible power of this system if you think about it the right way.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Most scientists using the 3-D fish data appear to be interested in measuring morphology \u2014 the length of a particular bone, for example \u2014 or looking for an aspect of anatomy never seen before. The scans allow you to zoom in digitally at many different angles, or print life-sized or larger plastic replicas of a fish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Summers has fine-tuned and expedited the process by scanning multiple fish at once. He first packs and rolls the specimens together like a burrito in a cylinder that is then placed directly in the scanner. After the machine makes one scan, Summers then digitally separates each 3-D fish into its own file.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Additionally, he doesn\u2019t scan at the highest-possible resolution, because few scientists actually need that much detailed data. This saves more time and digital space \u2014 and makes it possible for people to access the files more easily online.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe way transformative ideas do, these just instantly changed the way we think about scanning specimens,\u201d Summers said. \u201cWe went from, \u2018Is this possible?\u2019 to scanning whole series of fishes quickly.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So far about 515 species have been scanned and many are <a href=\"https:\/\/osf.io\/ecmz4\/wiki\/home\/\"><span class=\"s2\">posted online<\/span><\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/osf.io\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Open Science Framework<\/span><\/a>, an open-source, sharing website for scholarly projects.

In advance of the 2016 Bristol Bay sockeye salmon run, Schindler gave an inside look at the impact of the program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">For the Schindlers, limnology runs in the family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">As a child, Daniel Schindler split his time between Winnipeg and the freshwaters of northwestern Ontario, at a field camp his father ran for the Canadian federal government. There, Schindler\u2019s father studied acid rain and the eutrophication of lakes and rivers. And there, Schindler, unknowingly, began preparing for his life as professor of aquatic and fishery sciences and a lead investigator of one of the longest-running ecosystem research programs in the U.S.: the UW\u2019s Alaska Salmon Program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Even though he loved his nature-focused upbringing, Schindler never thought he\u2019d follow in his father\u2019s footsteps \u2014 he started his University of British Columbia experience on the pre-med track before switching gears \u2014\u202fbut, says Schindler, \u201cI knew I liked being outside, and I knew I liked having adventures. Eventually, I realized I wanted to go into ecology.\u201d So he did. \u201cThe first job I ever applied for out of graduate school was at the University of Washington,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I got it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The gig was in the Department of Zoology, but the summer before he started, professor Ray Hilborn \u2014 a fellow leader of the Alaska Salmon Program \u2014 invited Schindler to Bristol Bay, Alaska \u201cjust to check it out,\u201d he says. Twelve years ago, he followed his freshwater love and switched to the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences. \u201cIt\u2019s become a huge part of my life since.\u201d Schindler, who holds the Harriet Bullitt Endowed Chair in Conservation, will mark 20 field seasons in Alaska this summer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In Seattle, Schindler teaches undergraduate courses in freshwater sciences \u2014 one\u2019s a freshman-level class for non-majors that exposes students to issues associated with water conservation; the other\u2019s on limnology. But in the summers, he moves to a sleepy cabin on Lake Nerka \u2014 one of ASP\u2019s more remote field camps, only accessible by an hours-long boat ride or float plane \u2014\u202fand guides students through their research.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The big-picture goal at the core of ASP, says Schindler, is to understand how the watersheds \u2014\u202fsome of the most pristine in the world \u2014 work, so they can prioritize which parts should be protected and conserved. From there, Schindler and his colleagues are able to gain insights into how to manage and restore systems that have been overrun by people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThere are a lot of subtle processes that are still occurring naturally in Alaska that have simply been eliminated from human-affected watersheds across the world,\u201d says Schindler. \u201cIt\u2019s studies of intact watersheds like these that give clear insights into which aspects of the system should be restored and prioritized for protection.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">And the watersheds are truly intact. The sole management, beyond <i>not<\/i> developing roads and hydro dams that interfere with the natural systems, is regulating how many sockeye salmon can be harvested each year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In 2015, the sockeye salmon forecast was 54 million. The commercial fishery was allowed to harvest 41 million fish, leaving an escapement (the number of fish that continued upstream to spawn) of 13 million.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe only management that occurred was in determining how many fish could be caught,\u201d says Schindler. \u201cThose fish made their way into supermarkets and restaurants throughout the world, and no one farmed those fish or spawned those fish in hatcheries and planted them out in the ocean. The fish were produced from these watersheds, without intervention from humans.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Last year\u2019s run wound up coming in at 58 million \u2014 the third-largest run on record, and millions more than forecast \u2014 and ultimately, 36 million were harvested. In dollars? That\u2019s almost $100 million worth of sockeye salmon paid to fishermen, and additional countless jobs provided as the fish make their way through supply chains to consumers. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to take away from how these systems work,\u201d says Schindler.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">ASP has one of the longest running continuous data sets on fish and the watersheds that produce those fish \u2014 more than 70 years, to be exact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhen you have the opportunity to look back on years and years of observations of certain ecosystem components, you can draw inferences about how the systems are changing,\u201d says Schindler. \u201cYou can\u2019t get that if you\u2019re studying the world in three- or five-year blocks of time. At the end of the day, it\u2019s long-term scientific monitoring programs that have invaluable insights into how our planet is evolving.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">And that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to support and protect programs like ASP, says Schindler. The insights into the natural processes of watersheds \u2014 and how to replicate and restore processes that have been devastated by urban development \u2014 not only helps protect ecosystems, but teaches the next generation of students to lead the charge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe greatest luxury of being at the University of Washington is the quality students we attract,\u201d says Schindler. \u201cSelfishly, being able to have a research group of undergrads, grads, and post-docs who are at the top of their game makes my scientific life that much more satisfying.

So when my son declared his determination to keep returning to FHL for further study opportunities after spending a quarter there in the undergraduate ZooBot program a couple of years ago, I sat up and took notice. My son\u2019s enthusiasm for the FHL experience piqued my curiosity \u2014 I wanted to see this place for myself! So last August, my husband, daughter and I came to FHL from Chicago to visit my son for a few days while he conducted some independent undergrad research in the weeks after the regular summer class session ended.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I had learned from the website that families of current FHL students could rent cottages on the campus that were not being used by grad students or visiting research scientists. In the weeks before our departure, I contacted the awesome Bernadette Holthuis, who reserved a unit for us that featured a full kitchen, private bedroom, living, dining and bath rooms, at a rate you can\u2019t get in August at the island\u2019s regular hotels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We arrived on the island via ferry late in the afternoon near the end of last August. We texted our son to coordinate a meeting spot, but he did not answer, so we drove through the town toward FHL using our cell phone Maps app. As we drove along the private road leading into the FHL complex, I began to feel that I was on a secret mission. Maybe it was how still the surrounding woods stood as late afternoon sunlight spread over the leaves and branches. Maybe it was the wildlife I knew was there but was prudently remaining invisible, waiting for us to pass by.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We stopped the car and got out near the first group of buildings we saw. We entered the main building, hoping to find a person who could check us into the cabin we had reserved. We found the front office immediately but no one was there. This was not surprising, since FHL was on hiatus before the fall schedule kicked in. We went back outside and texted our son again but still received no reply, so we started exploring the grounds. We followed a dirt path that led to a series of wooden buildings\u2014a dining hall, a conference building, and other structures with porches that were clearly cabins. We saw several quietly foraging deer, but no human beings, so we decided to walk over to the nearby shoreline where we saw a pier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As we approached, we saw three figures in a small motorboat pulling up to the far end of the pier. Maybe they would be able to help us out. They secured the boat and climbed onto the pier. Two of them were wearing dry suits. As we got closer I began to smile\u2014one of the divers was our son! After welcome hugs and brief introductions, our son pulled the key to our cabin out of his gear bag and walked with us toward the nearby lodging area. Our cabin was just across the path from the Octopus building, where our son was staying. We were delighted with the spaciousness of our cabin and the full functionality of the kitchen. All of the cabins are close to the shore of the harbor and we enjoyed the sight and sound of a rumbling seaplane as it took off in the near distance beyond our porch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That first evening our son played chef, providing us with a dinner of fresh local crab legs and plenty of melted butter. Afterwards, he took us on a tour of the campus. We ducked into a couple of labs, touched some of the sea stars in the pool under the steps inside one of the main buildings, and saw his dorm room and the shared student kitchen area. When night fell, we took flashlights out onto the pier and observed anemones, shrimp and assorted plant life clinging to the sides of the pier just below the water\u2019s surface.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On the following days, we coordinated our own vacation activities on the island with our son\u2019s research schedule. He joined us for the beautiful hike to the lighthouse at Lime Kiln Point State Park, which is also a popular land-based whale-watching spot. But we explored the American Camp and Grandma\u2019s Cove by ourselves while he crunched data back at FHL. On day four, we spirited him away from the islands for a few days to visit Port Townsend and Lake Crescent in the Olympics.

Recent University of Washington School of Law graduate Mariah Hanley received an Equal Justice Works Fellowship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Projects developed by fellows address a wide range of legal issues including immigration, civil rights, juvenile justice, employment rights, health care, and domestic violence. Equal Justice Works matches fellows with sponsors to support their projects, which are completed at the host organization. Hanley, sponsored by Perkins Coie and Microsoft, will establish the Medical-Legal Partnership for Vets (MLPV) with the Department of Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Healthcare System as an attorney with Northwest Justice Project\u2019s Veterans Project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Beginning in September 2016, Hanley will work with two healthcare teams at the Seattle VA Medical Center, the Homeless Patient Aligned Care Team and the Women Veterans Program, to promote the health of homeless and women veterans through direct legal aid, healthcare provider training and systemic advocacy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe homeless and women veterans I will be advocating for are some of the most vulnerable populations the Department of Veterans Affairs serves,\u201d said Hanlely. \u201cHowever, no legal services organizations in Seattle provided dedicated legal representation to either population at the location where they are already seen for healthcare and social services. The Medical-Legal Partnership for Vets fills this gap in legal services delivery in the Puget Sound area.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">According to the annual CHALENG survey conducted by the Department of Veteran Affairs, five of the top ten unmet needs of homeless veterans in 2015 were legal in nature. Additionally, forty percent of women who are seen by the Women Veterans Program at the Seattle VA have experienced military sexual trauma, and thirty percent of women veterans nationally have experienced intimate partner violence. The Medical-Legal Partnership for Vets will provide legal assistance designed to increase the safety and stability of women veterans as well as eviction prevention and child support modification.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe veterans I will be serving have legal needs that can affect every facet of their lives,\" said Hanley. \"Civil legal aid is an important factor in improved health outcomes, and I look forward to working with the two incredible teams I\u2019m partnering with at the Seattle VA to make this a reality for my clients.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">During her time at UW School of Law, Hanley volunteered with the Northwest Justice Project, serving in roles including Student Law Clerk at the Veterans Project to assist veterans with their civil legal issues and as a Rule 9 clerk at the Medical-Legal Partnership, as well as in externships with Solid Ground and the RISE Project, assisting incarcerated and recently-released mothers with family law issues. Hanley also served as the co-president of the Student Health Law Organization, director of Auction Logistics for the Public Interest Law Association, and president and then vice president of the Disability Law Alliance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cAs attorneys, we have an immense amount of privilege, granted to us by virtue of our education, our knowledge, and our position in society,\" said Hanley. \"Public service, to me, means using that knowledge, that power, for good.

With more than 300,000 copies printed \u2013 and many cities using the guides in their employee orientation \u2013the Guide has proven to be a valuable and popular resource.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe whole guide is predicated on the idea that there are thoughtful people out there who want to learn,\" said Marlowe. \"They really want to know these things \u2014 they just don\u2019t know where to start.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The first two volumes of the Guide -- \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.governing.com\/papers\/A-Public-Official-s-Guide-to-Financial-Literacy.html\"><span class=\"s2\">Connecting Money, Policy and Priorities<\/span><\/a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.governing.com\/papers\/A-Guide-to-Managing-Your-Jurisdiction-s-Financial-Health-1500.html?promo_code=gov_papers_web_instituteslider\"><span class=\"s2\">Managing Your Jurisdiction\u2019s Financial Health<\/span><\/a>\u201d -- provide leaders with core understandings of public finance concepts as well as strategies and solutions for dealing with financial positions. Cities from coast to coast began adopting the Guide\u2019s tenets \u2013 for example, San Jos\u00e9 uses it to assess its general fund and Lowell, Massachusetts, used it to develop the FAQ section of its budget.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe did not expect that state and local officials would take the Guide's analytical framework and translate it into formal work products like performance audits,\u201d Marlowe explained. \u201cI think the framework works well to that effect because it's robust, even though it was never intended to guide formal, analytical work. Smart public officials made it work, and that's great.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With the Guide\u2019s growing popularity in mind and the complex workings of municipal finance a reality, Marlowe has continued the series. The recently released third volume, \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.governing.com\/papers\/Guide-to-Financial-Literacy-Vol-3-Understanding-the-Risks-Rewards-of-Public-Private-Partnerships-40501.html?promo_code=GOVERNING_web_library_list\"><span class=\"s2\">Understanding the Risks &amp; Rewards of Public-Private Partnerships<\/span><\/a>,\u201d defines a public-private partnership (called a P3), examines the appropriate role for policymakers, and addresses the pros and cons of the popular financing tool used by state and local governments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>P3s: A Deep Dive<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The third volume of the Guide emphasizes that public-private partnerships are mechanisms for <i>financing<\/i> projects, not <i>funding<\/i> them. Critics allege and even some supporters admit that the public and officials often consider P3s \u201cfree money.\u201d In no uncertain terms, they are not. The Guide describes them as \u201clong-term agreement(s) between a government and the private sector to share the risks and rewards of delivering an essential public service.\u201d Some examples include: an interstate project in Florida; the new civic center in Long Beach, California; and LaGuardia Airport\u2019s rebuilt terminal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">P3s have grown in popularity out of financial necessity. Cities and states have $8-10 trillion in serious infrastructure needs, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. Combine that fact with many public officials\u2019 belief that \u201clack of infrastructure investment is their most significant financial problem,\u201d and you can understand the widespread interest in P3s.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Addressing the infrastructure needs is the top reason, but design and technique innovation, the ability to overlap policy goals, and increased spending and borrowing capacity make P3s a permanent addition to policymakers\u2019 toolkits. Whether private contractors only supply the design or expand their work to include building, maintaining, operating, financing, and owning a project, the potential for both sides to benefit is attractive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Of course, risks go hand-in-hand with rewards, and the drawbacks are numerous. Taxpayers may have higher costs if projects are poorly designed or executed \u2013 and in that scenario, elected officials certainly pay the price, too. Even if the projects are well-run, governments might still need to actively monitor and provide enforcement. They usually do not have the resources nor the expertise to do so. And again, P3s are not free money. They are simply a way to combine the public sector\u2019s access to low-cost, tax-exempt financing with the private sector\u2019s expertise and agility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Maintenance might be the least-recognized yet largest risk faced by public projects. An old adage states that for every dollar spent designing a project, $10 will be spent on building it, and a whopping $100 to maintain it. Public officials can design their contracts intelligently to attempt to alleviate the problem, making payments to the contractors dependent on the asset\u2019s condition. This gives financial incentives to the private partner, which has (unlike governments) the operational and political will to do so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The beauty of the Guide lies in its ability to identify the numerous risks, and then provide the strategies that can mitigate the potential problems. From performance incentives and deductions that address construction, operations, and management issues, to contract provisions meant to deal with permits, approvals, and even \u201cActs of God,\u201d the Guide has policymakers covered.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Marlowe concludes not with mandates but proverbs for policymakers when considering a P3. He complements the proverbs with reminders that these are not hard and fast rules, but simply things to keep in mind \u2013 such as \u201ctrust is key BUT get the contract correct.\u201d If the popularity and widespread use of the \u201cFinancial Guide to Literacy\u201d is any indication, Marlowe is indeed getting it correct.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Seeds of hope","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/seeds-of-hope\/","tags":["alumni","school-of-social-work"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"In the name of holistic mental health, Christopher Brown, \u201916, created Growing Veterans, a sustainable farming organization that reconnects veterans to each other \u2014 and to life. Explore our interactive story featuring video and audio interviews.","content":"(UW Homepage, June 2016)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Christopher Brown squats among knee-high rows of green garlic. He grasps a stalk at its base and tugs it from the ground with a satisfying crunch. After popping several plants from the soil, he peels back their papery protective layers, revealing bulbs that are a brilliant, glossy white.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Six months ago, much of this Skagit Valley farmland was a mucky soup of tangled grass, mud and standing water under stormy skies. Today, it\u2019s a pleasant 70 degrees. Rows of produce, from garlic and sugar snap peas to kale and broccoli, spring from the valley\u2019s soft loam.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A three-time Marine combat veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, Brown struggled to adjust when he returned to the U.S. So, too, did many of the men and women who are now harvesting produce alongside him \u2014\u00a0military veterans from all branches, of all ages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Welcome to Growing Veterans, the thriving nonprofit that has transformed the life of Brown, its president and co-founder, and the lives of many of its workers and volunteers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Together, they use sustainable practices to plant, grow and harvest a rich variety of produce for sale at farmers markets and donation to food banks. It is satisfying work, but there\u2019s a deeper mission at stake: helping veterans reconnect \u2014 to each other, and to the communities they serve. And, in the process, tackling the pervasive isolation that underlies many of the issues they face.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the morning, they park their cars in the gravel driveway of a former dairy farm. They greet each other with hugs. As they work, they share stories \u2014 funny stories, sad stories, terrifying stories \u2014\u00a0from their time in the service. They talk politics. Medications. Family. Civilian life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brown has a story of his own. In 2008, he returned from his final tour of duty. \u201cThere was a lot of guilt, grief, anger, frustration and anxiety,\u201d he says. He also had to cope with a mild traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">His struggles were not unique. Along with PTSD, many returning veterans face depression. Substance abuse. Unemployment. Homelessness. And suicidal thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Brown\u2019s Marine battalion, the 2\/7, has a suicide rate four times that of all young male veterans. At least 15 men from the battalion have taken their own lives since he left the military.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhen I went back to get my undergraduate degree,\u201d he says, \u201cI made a commitment to myself that I would pursue an education and a career where those losses would not be in vain.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Brown also began working on his own mental health. He spent over two years in group and individual counseling, processing his traumas and learning coping strategies. Following the advice of his counselor, he started growing plants as a way to reconnect with life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Soon, he was harvesting food from his own garden for dinner, and he was feeling better and better. \u201cI realized that there really is something to working with food and growing plants,\u201d he says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">And then, just before he turned his thoughts to graduate school at the University of Washington, he says, it clicked: Why not combine food and sustainable agriculture with helping veterans?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For the past four years, he has done just that. Along with counselor-turned-farmer Christina Wolf, who serves as operations manager, Brown co-founded Growing Veterans on a 3.5-acre site north of Bellingham. The organization has since leased its expansive Skagit Valley location and a half-acre spot in Auburn, and continued to deepen its connections with regional farm agencies, veteran service providers and nonprofits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brown, who just completed his master\u2019s in social work at the UW, and Wolf have also deepened their organization\u2019s focus on mental health. Each of Growing Veterans\u2019 nine employees has completed a peer-support training program designed to tackle veteran isolation and prevent suicide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">And beyond providing life-sustaining social support at its farms, Growing Veterans helps people connect with as many meaningful opportunities as possible: through other local and national veteran organizations, business and community networking, and educational projects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">There\u2019s plenty of excitement cropping up for Growing Veterans. More community partners. More acreage planted. More people receiving healthy, sustainably grown produce. More veterans beginning the journey to healing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">But there\u2019s also tremendous power in the present: The warmth of the sun. The fertile soil that gently gives way under each step. And the rhythm with which dirt-covered, callused hands pick and peel bunches of garlic, set them aside, and then begin anew.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>MASTER OF SOCIAL WORK: MORE THAN CREDENTIALS<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">When Growing Veterans was just getting off its feet, Christopher Brown embarked upon another journey: He took on a master\u2019s degree in social work at the University of Washington.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Now a newly minted graduate, Brown recently transitioned from executive director of Growing Veterans to president of the board of directors \u2014 freeing up time to launch his career as a PTSD counselor for veterans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Brown says the UW\u2019s flexible <a href=\"http:\/\/socialwork.uw.edu\/programs\/master-of-social-work-program\"><span class=\"s2\">M.S.W. extended degree program<\/span><\/a> gave him much more than just the tools and credentials he needed to be a counselor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">His professors supported him as he focused many of his research projects on furthering the mission of Growing Veterans. And, though his concentration was in integrative health and mental health practice, Brown also learned about leadership and community building.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cMany of my professors also ran their own foundations and brought their worldly experience to the classroom,\u201d he says. \u201cThey helped challenge and refine not only my understanding of how to work with others, but my view of the world, too.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>CRISIS AND MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES:<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>National Suicide Prevention Lifeline<\/b>\n1-800-273-TALK (8255)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>At the UW<\/b>\n206-685-SAFE (7233)\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/safecampus\/index.html\"><span class=\"s2\">SafeCampus<\/span><\/a>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/safecampus\/student\/resources-uw.html\"><span class=\"s2\">Student resources<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>In Seattle\/King County<\/b>\n866-4-CRISIS (427-4747)\n<a href=\"http:\/\/crisisclinic.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Crisis Clinic<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s3\"><b>On your phone<\/b>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/t2health.dcoe.mil\/apps\/virtual-hope-box\"><span class=\"s2\">Virtual Hope Box<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>VETERAN RESOURCES:<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.va.gov\/\">Department of Veterans Affairs<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.veteranscrisisline.net\/\">Veteran crisis line<\/a><\/span><span class=\"s1\">\n1-800-273-8255\u00a0(press 1)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Confidential counseling:\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.va.gov\/directory\/guide\/vetcenter.asp\"><span class=\"s2\">find a vet center<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>VETERANS AT THE UW:<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/vetlife\/\">Seattle<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.uwb.edu\/studentaffairs\/veterans\">Bothell<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tacoma.uw.edu\/veterans-military-services\">Tacoma<\/a><\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Good food, not gone to waste","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/good-food-not-gone-to-waste\/","tags":["public-health"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"The UW School of Public Health is working\u00a0with the City of Seattle to combat hunger, reduce discards.","content":"(HS NewsBeat, June 2016)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Forty percent of food in the United States\u2014much of it healthy and edible\u2014goes uneaten.

Meanwhile, more than 48 million Americans aren\u2019t getting the food they need, while food banks are struggling to meet demand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To reverse that trend, the City of Seattle enlisted the UW School of Public Health to analyze current food waste prevention and recovery efforts and help develop local strategies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The new <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/uwcphn\/reports\/SeattleFoodWasteReport.PDF\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>report<\/b><\/span><\/a>\u00a0(PDF) from the School\u2019s Center for Public Health Nutrition suggests that public agencies are in a position to foster an integrated local and regional approach.

Researchers talked to eight anti-hunger agencies, five public agencies, one non-governmental organization, and 12 food businesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The researchers came up with 11 key recommendations for the City of Seattle... <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Among them:<\/span><\/p>\n\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n\t<li class=\"li5\"><span class=\"s1\">Develop a food waste and recovery roundtable\u00a0 to foster a comprehensive approach across all sectors<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li class=\"li5\"><span class=\"s1\">Develop and implement standard food waste metrics<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li class=\"li5\"><span class=\"s1\">Make the case for reducing food waste from the consumer level to the food service industry<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li class=\"li5\"><span class=\"s1\">Increase infrastructure and capacity of the emergency food system<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The report also identified the challenges faced by anti-hunger agencies, public agencies and food businesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For anti-hunger agencies, the most cited challenge was inadequate storage space, particularly for perishables that are often the most nutritious items.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Another challenge included difficulty in coordinating efficient pick-up or delivery of donations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Challenges for public agencies ranged from a lack of coordination internally among individuals working on the food waste system to high employee turnover in the commercial sector.\u00a0 This affects the training and technical assistance they can provide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Food businesses, such as grocery stores and restaurants, need to deal with customer expectations of quality of food, misconceptions about sell-by and use-by dates, and the unpredictability of consumer purchases. To reduce food waste, businesses have explored various strategies, such as waste audits and small-batch cooking. They have also kept tight tabs on inventory and order as little stock as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Results from this project can help public agencies to better support food waste prevention and recovery efforts in the future, according to the report.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The report also highlights the lack of common metrics for determining how much food is thrown away and how much it is worth. Numbers would not only help incentivize change, but also demonstrate impact, the report notes. However, few food businesses in the study tracked their food donations and each anti-hunger agency used different metrics to do so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe really need a national language and some national metrics to understand the problem better and the effectiveness of solutions,\u201d Otten said. This month a partnership of leading international organizations, including the United Nations, unveiled <a href=\"http:\/\/flwprotocol.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\">a global standard<\/span><\/a> to measure food waste.

Megan is all in, all of the time.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Below, Kufeld answers eight questions about her UW experience:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>WHAT ASPECT OF BIOLOGY INTRIGUES YOU THE MOST?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The molecular foundation of life \u2014 all of the signals, interactions, and processes that occur at the molecular level within individual cells and between all the cells of a body in order for life to exist and thrive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>YOU WORKED IN A FACULTY RESEARCH LABORATORY FOR TWO YEARS. HOW DID THAT ENHANCE YOUR ACADEMICS?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Working in lab is incredible, including the opportunity to experience firsthand the \u201cscientific method\u201d that we only read about or briefly experience in courses. Additionally, I was able to use a great deal of what I learned in class \u2014 from research techniques to the foundational science governing every molecular event \u2014 in my lab work. I have learned, practiced, and now feel confident in many molecular, cellular, and biochemical research skills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>WHAT ADVICE CAN YOU OFFER OTHER STUDENT ATHLETES JUGGLING ACADEMICS, ATHLETICS, AND OTHER COMMITMENTS?\u00a0<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While it can be challenging to balance multiple commitments, I think it is very doable. What really helped me was always having a plan, managing my time, and not allowing myself to stray from my plan. Even if possible distractions or excuses came up, those were not as important as my desire to put my best towards my academics and athletics. So in terms of advice, I would say prioritize your commitments and then make a plan for dividing your time between these commitments. When other things come up, remind yourself what is most important to you!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>WHAT\u2019S ONE THING YOU WISH YOU\u2019D KNOWN WHEN YOU STARTED AT THE UW?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How fast it really goes by! Take advantage of and enjoy the opportunity to be at such an amazing place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>IS THERE ONE OPPORTUNITY YOU HAD AT THE UW THAT YOU FEEL SET YOU ON YOUR CURRENT PATH?\u00a0<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The opportunity to work in the Wang Lab, experiencing research and learning that I enjoy it, has allowed me to feel confident in pursuing a career in research.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>DID YOU TAKE COURSES OUTSIDE OF YOUR MAJOR THAT SURPRISED YOU?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yes! Through the Interdisciplinary Honors Program curriculum, I was able to take many unique courses beyond the field of biology. I took a course on the political capacity of making textile art; the ideology of human rights movements; the enactment of leadership; issues of social justice within urbanization; the expansive response to oil spills; global climate change; a health seminar on aspects of college life; the social, moral, and political context of education and schooling; and ancient architecture. These were all great experiences that challenged me, expanding the breadth and perspective of my education.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>WHAT\u2019S THE CAMPUS SPOT YOU\u2019LL MISS THE MOST, AND WHY?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It's a tie between 1) the view walking through campus on a sunny day from the Quad through Red Square to the fountain, seeing Mt. Rainier in the distance \u2014 because in those moments I couldn\u2019t help but notice the beauty and feel happy; and 2) the soccer field\/athletic department, because it\u2019s where I spent so much of my time, the source of so many lifelong memories and friendships, and instills such a strong sense of pride, unity, and inspiration in being a Husky!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>WHAT\u2019S NEXT FOR YOU?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Currently I am living out a lifelong dream by playing professional soccer in the second division in Sweden! I hope to advance to higher levels in upcoming seasons. Post-soccer, I envision attending graduate school and pursuing a career in molecular and cellular biology research, potentially in the biomedical\/biotech field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>READ MORE<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n\t<li class=\"li7\"><span class=\"s4\"><a href=\"https:\/\/artsci.washington.edu\/news\/related\/Biology\/all\"><span class=\"s5\">Biology<\/span><\/a><\/span><span class=\"s6\">\n<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li class=\"li7\"><span class=\"s7\"><a href=\"https:\/\/artsci.washington.edu\/news\/related\/Honors%20and%20Awards\/all\"><span class=\"s5\">Honors and Awards<\/span><\/a><\/span><span class=\"s6\">\n<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li class=\"li7\"><span class=\"s7\"><a href=\"https:\/\/artsci.washington.edu\/news\/related\/Natural%20Sciences\/all\"><span class=\"s5\">Natural Sciences<\/span><\/a><\/span><span class=\"s6\">\n<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li class=\"li7\"><span class=\"s7\"><a href=\"https:\/\/artsci.washington.edu\/news\/related\/Perspectives\/all\"><span class=\"s5\">Perspectives<\/span><\/a><\/span><span class=\"s6\">\n<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li class=\"li7\"><span class=\"s7\"><a href=\"https:\/\/artsci.washington.edu\/news\/related\/Profiles\/all\"><span class=\"s5\">Profiles<\/span><\/a><\/span><span class=\"s6\">\n<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li class=\"li7\"><span class=\"s7\"><a href=\"https:\/\/artsci.washington.edu\/news\/related\/Research\/all\"><span class=\"s5\">Research<\/span><\/a><\/span><span class=\"s6\">\n<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li class=\"li7\"><span class=\"s7\"><a href=\"https:\/\/artsci.washington.edu\/news\/related\/Student%20Experience\/all\"><span class=\"s5\">Student Experience<\/span><\/a><\/span><span class=\"s6\">\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>"},{"title":"From racehorses to research","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/from-racehorses-to-research\/","tags":["arts-sciences","giving","graduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"When an assistant racehorse trainer and\u00a0mother of three returned to school, she discovered a passion for research.","content":"<p class=\"p1\">(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, June 2016)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">No one would describe Jennifer Smith as a traditional college student. The mother of three, who left school after ninth grade, worked as an assistant racehorse trainer for 14 years before finding her way back to academia. Now Smith, with majors in <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/history\/department-history\"><span class=\"s2\">history <\/span><\/a>and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/chid.washington.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">comparative history of ideas <\/span><\/a>(CHID) and a minor in <a href=\"https:\/\/ais.washington.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">American Indian studies<\/span><\/a>, has been named the <b>Dean\u2019s Medalist in the Humanities<\/b>. The College of Arts &amp; Sciences awards the Dean\u2019s\u00a0Medal to one exceptional graduating senior in each of its four divisions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Smith transferred to the University of Washington from Green River Community College and discovered a passion for research while participating in the UW\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/undergradresearch\/summer\/siah\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Summer Institute in the Arts and Humanities<\/span><\/a>. Through her research, she has combined her interests in history, politics, Indigenous communities, and horses, with a sophistication that is \u201cmore like an advanced graduate student rather than an undergraduate one,\u201d according to research mentor Mar\u00eda Elena Garc\u00eda, professor and director of CHID.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Smith has received numerous scholarships along the way, including two Mary Gates research scholarships, an Early Identification Program Presidential Scholarship, the History Department\u2019s Faye Wilson Scholarship, a CHID Research Scholarship, and the Thomas Powers Paper Prize. She has\u00a0mentored other students interested in research, working with the UW <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/undergradresearch\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Undergraduate Research Program<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Though she has graduated, Smith has not left the UW. This fall she will rejoin the Department of History as a graduate student working toward a PhD. \u201cOver the course of the time I have known her, Jennifer has gone from wondering if she belongs in the academy to exploring ways to remake it,\u201d says Garc\u00eda. \u201cShe is poised to make serious contributions to histories of Indigenous peoples, the environment, and the U.S. West, and to the critical study of race, gender, and species.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Below, Smith answers six questions about her UW experience:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>WHAT LED YOU BACK TO SCHOOL AT THIS TIME IN YOUR LIFE?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I wanted to be a better role model for my children and be able to help them with homework as they grew older. Having no more than a ninth grade education, and a job that required me to relocate frequently and work seven days per week, I knew that I could not be the mother my children deserved if I didn't educate myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>IS THERE ONE OPPORTUNITY YOU HAD AT THE UW THAT YOU FEEL SET YOU ON YOUR CURRENT PATH?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">My involvement in the 2014 Summer Institute for the Arts and Humanities (SIAH) really opened my eyes to the ways in which people outside of STEM fields could engage in research and make meaningful contributions across disciplines. That experience ignited a fire in me, increasing my participation in research and fostering\u00a0relationships with faculty and peers across a variety of disciplines. I still maintain contact with some of my SIAH cohort, and Professor Mar\u00eda Elena Garc\u00eda, who served as SIAH faculty, remains my primary research mentor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>WHAT HAS BEEN THE FOCUS OF YOUR RESEARCH?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I am particularly interested in the complex and diverse ways that Indigenous communities resist colonial hegemony \u2014 both in the past and present \u2014 and through my research found that the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama effectively used horses as a tool of resistance that allowed them to retain access to meaningful lands and resources during the first half of the twentieth century. Faculty helped me refine my research questions and find scholarly sources to review, but they also allowed me to work independently. I cannot express how much I appreciate the faith faculty members have had in my ability to engage in meaningful, original research without constant supervision.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>AS AN ADVOCATE FOR RESEARCH IN THE ARTS, HUMANITIES, AND SOCIAL SCIENCES, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT RESEARCH IN THESE FIELDS?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I think it is important for people to know that research within these fields is equally as important as research in STEM fields and worthy of support and recognition. There needs to be more cross-disciplinary collaboration to bridge the divide between STEM\/Social Sciences\/Humanities fields. You cannot reduce the human experience to a series of molecules or calculations. Conversely, theory and rhetoric cannot singlehandedly solve real-world problems. We need each other and if we spend more time working together instead of in isolation, there is space to do some really great things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>YOU HAVE RECEIVED QUITE A FEW SCHOLARSHIPS. \u00a0WHAT HAS THAT SUPPORT MEANT TO YOU?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It has provided a sense of validation \u2014 that what I am doing is\u00a0important and recognized \u2014 and has allowed me to not rely so heavily on loans and alleviated some financial stresses.\u00a0I cannot\u00a0begin to express my\u00a0gratitude for all of\u00a0the scholarships and awards I\u00a0have received\u00a0during my time at the University of Washington. It is truly an honor, and for a woman who never graduated\u00a0high school and was out of school for two decades, the attention and recognition feels very surreal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>YOU WERE ADMITTED \u2014 WITH FUNDING \u2014 TO FIVE PHD PROGRAMS IN HISTORY.

Standing 13 feet at the shoulders and weighing between 18,000\u201322,000 pounds, with tusks that could reach 14 feet in length, these were the largest species of mammoths. They existed alongside early humans and were the last of their kind to walk the earth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture wants to give visitors the opportunity to stand in front of one of these great beasts when it opens its <a href=\"http:\/\/newburke.org\/home\"><span class=\"s2\">new building on the University of Washington campus in 2019<\/span><\/a>. Museum staff plan to display a Columbian Mammoth skeleton discovered near Richland, Washington in the new exhibition hall. The problem is that they only have about 20% of its bones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">UW engineering students and instructors are now working with museum staff to scan, digitize and 3-D print the missing parts of the mammoth skeleton. Thanks to a new interdisciplinary class, the museum\u2019s plans to share the Richland mammoth are not only moving forward but are also expanding into the digital realm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThis project is where Jurassic Park meets the Star Trek replicator,\u201d explains Steven Weidner, an affiliate instructor from UW's mechanical engineering department who is leading the class. \u201cBy printing this mammoth, we\u2019re pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible with large-scale 3-D printing.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s become a mammoth of a collaborative project, so to speak \u2014 one that could fundamentally change how the Burke\u2019s collections are documented, stored and shared with public audiences and scientific communities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>\u2018Together we figure out the best techniques\u2019<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Complete skeletons of any animal are rare in paleontology. It's not uncommon for museums to display partial skeletons, with missing pieces typically sculpted by hand using foam and clay. But that process can be time-consuming and inexact, says Burke collections manager Meredith Rivin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As for the Richland mammoth, the museum has most of its limb bones and portions of the skull and mandibles, but to exhibit it permanently, they need to reproduce a number of missing parts. 3-D printing, Rivin says, will allow for more accurate reconstructions in far less time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That's why museum staff connected with Weidner in fall 2015. He had initially approached the Burke about a different 3-D printing project idea, but when Burke staff expressed their need for replacement mammoth bones, Weidner enthusiastically accepted the challenge. Working through the College of Engineering\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/vip.uw.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">VIP program<\/span><\/a> and with Burke staff, he created plans for a multi-year 3-D printing project that would allow UW students to learn and apply additive manufacturing technologies to museum collection management and exhibition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In Weidner\u2019s class, undergraduate and graduate students from various disciplines work together to create 3-D scans and 3-D printed replicas of mammoth bones and other artifacts from the Burke\u2019s collection. The course has met for two quarters so far; to reflect the project\u2019s interdisciplinary nature, each session has been offered by different academic departments \u2014 in Winter 2016 through mechanical engineering and Spring 2016 through biology. Access to engineering 3-D printing experts has enhanced the students\u2019 experience. Guest lecturers have included Mark Ganter, co-lead of the <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/open3dp\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Solheim Rapid Prototyping\/Rapid Manufacturing Lab<\/span><\/a> and professor of mechanical engineering, who facilitated a class on powder-bed printing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Students serve as an engineering consulting team for the Burke and meet regularly with their staff. Through hands-on experimentation, they test a variety of 3-D scanners (ranging from handheld infrared scanners to photogrammetry and CT scans), digital record-keeping techniques, modeling software and 3-D printers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Weidner describes the class as \u201ca learning environment that emulates working in a professional environment\u201d \u2014 once the students define the problems, they must research the technologies needed to solve them. This means adopting and experimenting with an array of tools, figuring out how they work, their capabilities and limitations and, when necessary, developing the skillsets required to use them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s an approach that appeals to many engineering students, including a pre-engineering junior, Kurt Weiss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cAn opportunity to work with fossils and cutting-edge scanning and modeling technologies? I signed up for the class immediately,\u201d says Weiss, who recently transferred from Bellevue College. At the UW, he\u2019s studying aerospace and, after graduating, hopes to work in aerodynamic design and structures engineering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThese areas deal heavily with 3-D renderings and scaled models testing within wind tunnels,\u201d he says. \u201cSo the experience I\u2019m getting through this class with the wide variety of scanning equipment, modeling programs and printing technologies is helping me develop the knowledge and skills I\u2019ll need down the road.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Approximately 20 students have enrolled each quarter, ranging from first-year undergrads to graduate students. About half of them come from engineering departments: mechanical engineering, aeronautics and astronautics and human centered design and engineering. Others are from museology, geology, paleobiology, archeology and photomedia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">First-year pre-engineering student Kaiyu Shi has greatly valued the opportunity to collaborate with students from other disciplines. \u201cMost of my classes are math and physics, so learning how students from other areas across campus approach a project like this has been eye-opening,\u201d he says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Garrett Mercier, a museology graduate student, agrees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cTogether we figure out the best techniques,\u201d he says. \u201cThe engineering students often bring more knowledge about the technologies and equipment than the museum folks have, but we have the knowledge about the collections, the bones, their histories and importance. And we\u2019re all working together to come up with the best way to document and share them.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Scanning, compiling, printing<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To complete the missing parts of the Richland mammoth, the class is scanning bones from other mammoths in the Burke\u2019s collection, as well as making mirror-image copies of bones that already exist from the Richland mammoth itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Scanning takes place at the Burke, where the bones are housed and scanned one at a time. Weiss says they plan about three hours of scanning time per small to medium-sized bones; larger specimens, like the skull, can take more than five hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">3-D scanning not only makes it possible to print replicas of missing bones and incomplete fossils, but the scans themselves also provide new and valuable data on the mammoth\u2019s anatomy. And since they\u2019re digital, the Burke will make them accessible online to researchers worldwide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cOur goal is to provide a complete digital atlas of the mammoth \u2014 and eventually, other fossils \u2014 that can be used by researchers and the general public to answer research questions and for education,\u201d explains Rivin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Once the data is captured, it is modeled for printing. To determine best print strategies, the class has worked closely with <a href=\"http:\/\/students.washington.edu\/woof3d\/\"><span class=\"s2\">WOOF3D<\/span><\/a>, a student-led 3-D printing club in the College of Engineering. Some of the engineering students in the class, like Shi, are also members of WOOF3D where they design and build desktop-size and large-scale 3-D printers. The club is currently prototyping Big Blue, a large-scale 3-D printer with a 1.5 cubic meter build space to accommodate mammoth\u2019s larger bones, such as the skull, femur and jaw bone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although many of the larger pieces are on hold for Big Blue, the class has already 3-D printed several smaller bones, such as the mammoth\u2019s vertebrae (back bones) and metatarsals (toe bones). Different printers yield different outputs, and so the class is constantly working to refine the finished products.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIn every scan and printed item, we aim for perfection,\u201d Weidner says. \u201c\u2018Good enough\u2019 doesn\u2019t cut it in engineering or in scientific research, and so we must ensure our final results are as close to the real thing as possible.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><b>Ongoing partnership<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Rivin and Weidner anticipate that the data digitization and 3-D printing will continue to evolve over the next few years until the Richland mammoth is permanently displayed. Weidner wants to offer the course again next year; he\u2019s certain that every future step of the project will invite new challenges and problems to solve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Rivin is particularly inspired by the students\u2019 grasp and application of advanced technologies. \u201cThey\u2019re fearless and curious,\u201d she observes. \u201cThey\u2019re not intimidated by the scope of the project or its hurdles but instead are eager for the challenges.

A pelican flies by on the other. Sally Jewell perches in the lead Seawolf, looking into the wind as the convoy motors into the largest seagrass system in the world. The 51st Secretary of the Interior is visiting the Florida Everglades on April 22 to see firsthand the troubled drainage system that connects the national park\u2019s flooded grasslands and swamps to the salty bay. Fresh water draining from lands miles up into the state should filter into the bay, diluting the water, but because of drought last year, this sensitive ecosystem is now twice as salty as the ocean, making it much less habitable for plants, fish and wildlife.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As water laps the boat bottoms, the rangers explain that rainfall deficits, boating behaviors and climate change have fostered massive die-offs of seagrass in the shallow basins and channels, toxifying the water and killing the fish. Jewell examines a piece of seagrass in her fingers and proffers questions about unblocking the freshwater flows and reviving the dead zones. The issue is much larger than the 2,300-square-mile national park and broader than the survival of the sea turtle and manatee. It affects the drinking water in Miami and whether, as the sea level is predicted to rise one and a half feet by 2060, the seawater will inundate the city and its suburbs, affecting a population of more than 6 million. Marshes could collapse, plants and animals could die, and the damage may blight the entire southern end of Florida. \u201cThis is bigger than climate change, alone,\u201d says Jewell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The 60-year-old UW alumna is out of her traditional element. She is far from her home state of Washington, her two grown children, her favorite hiking trails, and her various community roles as a member of nonprofit boards, UW Regent, and CEO of Recreational Equipment Inc., a Northwest cultural and business landmark.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Now the steamy Everglades are her landscape, along with the 411 National Park areas and 530 million acres of public lands. Since 2013, Jewell has been tasked with policing poachers and giving every fourth-grader and their families a free access pass to all federally managed lands and waters. She faces issues of fracking, climate change (and its deniers), and efforts and pressure to sell acres of public lands into private ownership. Some people want her to open up more land to ranching and mining. Others would rather she leave everything untouched.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe are in the forever business,\u201d is her mantra. The driving focus of Jewell\u2019s job is delivering healthy public lands and waters to future generations, while supporting a strong economy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Created in 1849 to oversee the nation\u2019s internal affairs, the Department of the Interior encompasses many things: the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation and Enforcement. There are seven other bureaus, the most public of which is the National Park Service, which turns 100 this year. The federal government owns about half the land in the West, and most of it falls under Jewell\u2019s domain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She has granite-colored hair and a lean physique. In spite of a rigorous travel schedule that included heading to Oregon for a dam removal one week, Puerto Rico to protect public lands from development the next and now Florida the third, she looks primed for a 10-mile hike. \u201cHow do you do it? How do you keep looking so good?\u201d asks a woman at a sunbaked social later that Everglades day. Without skipping a beat, Jewell breaks into a grin and quips, \u201cI always take the stairs.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Born in London in 1956, Sarah Margaret \u201cSally\u201d Roffey became a Washingtonian before kindergarten. Her father had landed a fellowship in anesthesiology at the UW School of Medicine and one of the first things he did to acclimate the family to the Northwest was join REI and buy a tent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">By the country\u2019s first Earth Day, in 1970, Jewell was a teenager, had an affinity for hiking, boating and camping and was planning her first attempt on Mount Rainier. She credits her enthusiasm for the outdoors to teacher Ladell Black, \u201959, who led small groups of children on rugged two-week camping trips in Washington each summer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Black studied forestry at the UW. The only woman in the College of Forest Resources at the time, she had to drop out because the teachers couldn\u2019t accommodate her in the student housing in Pack Forest, the UW\u2019s research and education forest. \u201cSo I went into botany,\u201d says Black. \u201cAnd back then what did women botany majors do? They taught.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the early 1960s, Black was hired by the Northwest Gifted Child Association to lead precocious children into the wilderness for \u201cwhat\u00a0 today I would call an ecology camping program,\u201d she says. The parents demanded a rigorous academic experience to challenge the 9- and 10-year-olds. \u201cSally and her family were different,\u201d says Black. They wanted to teach her to be inquisitive and resourceful. And little Sally was intrepid, wading into the sound to collect kelp, documenting her experiences in her journal, even climbing trees (and falling out of one, coming home with a broken wrist).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI remember having pine cone fights and playing games and collecting insects,\u201d says Jewell. She also learned to identify trees, start a fire, map an island, and even conduct an archaeological dig. \u201cAll of these things were put on my radar at age nine,\u201d says Jewell. \u201cIt really taught me to look at nature in different ways.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe just gave them what all children deserve,\u201d says Black, \u201crespect, a variety of experience, and independence.\u201d Though in her 80s and retired in Eastern Washington, Black still works with children, bringing kids out of Colville to explore the Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge. \u201cI just wish all children could have those opportunities,\u201d says Jewell. \u201cWe are not nurturing that enough.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Young Sally hadn\u2019t yet imagined that her love of the outdoors might lead to a vocation. In her Renton High School yearbook, she wrote that she aspired to be a dental hygienist. \u201cWhy would I say that?\u201d she asks, as we visit at a picnic table. \u201cPart of that was the time. My family was enlightened, but my siblings and I were encouraged to be practical with our studies.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Washington Pre-College Test, which was designed to guide Washington students in choosing careers, directed Jewell to nursing, Russian studies, or teaching. \u201cBut I scored high on mechanical reasoning and spatial ability,\u201d says Jewell. \u201cMeanwhile, my roommate in Haggett Hall scored better in arts and literature, yet the test recommended the exact same careers for her.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When she met Warren Jewell, a mechanical engineering student, she was primed for a new course. \u201cWarren\u2019s homework looked a lot more interesting than mine,\u201d she says, explaining how she came to be an engineering major. As classmates they found they shared more than an interest in engineering, and went on their first date on Sally\u2019s 18th birthday. Their courtship included ski trips, hiking, and camping in places like LaPush. They married in 1978, a week after graduation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While she was at the UW, Jewell\u2019s engineering studies led to a gig with General Electric, working on components for the Alaska Pipeline. After college, she considered more than a dozen job offers before she and Warren, \u201978, accepted positions with Mobil Oil in Oklahoma oil and gas fields. After a few years in the Southwest, the pair \u201cdesperately missed\u201d Seattle, says Jewell. Both applied for the job of petroleum engineer at Rainier Bank. Sally landed it, and they moved home. She flourished at the bank and is credited for protecting it from making bad loans to the oil industry at a time when many other banks did and failed. \u201cMy role there is overstated,\u201d Jewell is quick to say. \u201cI was just 26 when I started. But it was a great opportunity to work with good people and be respected.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At the time, Rainier\u2019s leaders understood that healthy banks depended on healthy communities, says Jewell. At the urging of her supervisors, she started volunteering. She was a founding board member of the Mountains to Sound Greenway Trust and, among other things, a UW Regent from 2001-2013. She also served as a trustee for the National Parks Conservation Association.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After 19 years in banking, Jewell changed course again to become REI\u2019s chief operating officer in 2000 and its CEO in 2005.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Then the White House called. In 2008, the Obama transition team inquired about her interest in public service. \u201cIt was a bad time at REI,\u201d says Jewell. The economy had turned, sales had plummeted, and \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could walk out on the organization.\u201d But in 2012, when the White House called again, REI was in a better position, and she was ready. Jewell credits Jerry Grinstein, former CEO of Delta Air Lines and former UW Regent, and William Ruckelshaus, the founding director of the Environmental Protection Agency, with encouraging her to pursue the job. She understood many of the issues, thanks to her background, but she wasn\u2019t a typical appointee. Her predecessor Ken Salazar had been a U.S. senator and the secretary before him was attorney general of Colorado. Jewell had never been in politics. \u201cShe\u2019s an unusual appointment,\u201d says Ruckelshaus. \u201cBut the breadth of her experience and her fundamental judgment have greatly served her. The president is to be credited for seeing that she was an excellent choice.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ruckelshaus met Jewell in the early 2000s while serving on the Initiative for Global Development, a nonprofit that works with the private sector to alleviate poverty in Africa. Having seen Jewell learn quickly and respond well in difficult situations, he encouraged her nomination for the cabinet position. \u201cI\u2019m a great admirer of Sally\u2019s. I think she\u2019s an almost perfect person for that job,\u201d he says. \u201cShe has a talent for listening, reasoning, and making difficult decisions. I saw her make the fine balances you have to make.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Jewell quickly found support on both sides of the aisle. During her confirmation hearings, Sen. Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee, remarked on her work in petroleum and banking and then leading a billion-dollar company. \u201cYou sound more like the nominee of a Republican administration,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In her three years as Interior\u2019s head, Jewell has nudged the department to reduce the extraction of natural resources and toward promoting other, more sustainable benefits of the lands, not the least of which is recreation. She has also made climate change a priority for all her bureaus and departments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Now, in her last months in office (it is customary for a cabinet member to resign at a change in administration), she hopes to connect more Americans with their public lands. \u201cDo you know the amount of time children today spend in front of a screen?\u201d she asks. \u201cFifty-six hours a week, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. And less than 30 minutes in unstructured outside play.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The future of our lands depends on these children, she says. With millions of dollars in donations from companies like American Eagle Outfitters, REI Foundation, American Express Foundation, Thule, Coca-Cola and others, and more than $3 million from federal sources, the recently launched 21st Century Conservation Corps can now put thousands of young people and veterans to work on public land service projects nationwide. That, along with the Every Kid in a Park program for fourth-graders and the National Park Service\u2019s Find Your Park campaign, should give more American children, and by extension, more families, an opportunity to experience national parks and other public lands and waters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In eight months, Jewell intends to treat herself and Warren to some unstructured time by loading up the car and hitting that ribbon of a highway out of the capital. \u201cWhen I\u2019m done with this job, I\u2019m going to find a lot of parks and public lands on a slow drive back to Seattle.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>This story originally appeared in the June 2016 issue of Columns Magazine, the official magazine for UW Alumni.

Slowly, they lower the 20-foot-long, 201-pound boat into the water. After a few heart-pounding moments, the canoe stays afloat, and the group erupts into cheers, a fitting celebration considering the material their vessel is made of: concrete.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Since 1975, UW students have put their minds \u2014 and paddles \u2014 together for the <a href=\"http:\/\/students.washington.edu\/uwcanoe\/\"><span class=\"s2\">UW\u2019s Concrete Canoe Team<\/span><\/a>. Over the course of only a few months, the team\u2019s 40 members design, build and race a canoe against collegiate teams from across the country. Throughout these four decades, the UW team has earned a strong reputation, with 12 regional championships and four top-10 national finishes under their belt. And beyond the competition, Concrete Canoe has created boundless learning opportunities for the students involved.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWith Concrete Canoe, we\u2019re stepping into the unknown,\u201d says Kim Tsai, a senior studying civil and environmental engineering and co-captain of the team. Since building a concrete canoe is, Tsai admits, a \u201cquirky challenge,\u201d the only resources available to the students are universal engineering principles, some elbow grease and the experiences of past teams. \u201cIt really is us sitting down and thinking about our basic engineering skills: the dynamics and mechanics that make sense,\u201d she says. \u201cThis competition teaches us so much.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Emboldened by the challenge ahead of them, the team \u2014 which is completely student-run, from construction to fundraising to even transporting the canoe across the country \u2014 gets down to work in early fall quarter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The first step is to determine the perfect concrete mix, testing at a rate of about four mixes per week. Next, they tackle the boat\u2019s design and shape, which ultimately determine its performance on the water: While a straighter, skinnier design will help the boat cut through the water, a shorter, wider boat can turn more easily. Finally, the team decides on a theme for their canoe; in keeping with a tradition of paying tribute to the Pacific Northwest, this year\u2019s canoe \u2014 dubbed the \u201cEdgewater\u201d \u2014 incorporates the industrial-steampunk aesthetic of Seattle\u2019s iconic Gas Works Park.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In April the team headed to the University of Idaho for the Pacific Northwest regional competition. After three days of racing and presenting their canoe design, the months of hard work paid off \u2014 the team took first place, extending their regional winning streak to four consecutive years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Next up? The 2016 National Concrete Canoe Competition at the University of Texas at Tyler in June. While they hope to achieve another top finish, at the end of the day, \u201cthis is really about the relationships you make,\u201d says Tsai. Outside of meetings, it\u2019s typical to see senior members mentoring younger students or teammates helping each other with homework. A Concrete Canoe alumni network is also part of the group\u2019s extended family, and many students have landed internships or jobs through the connections. \u201cWe joined because building a concrete canoe is an exciting challenge,\u201d Tsai says, \u201cbut we stayed because we\u2019ve developed a community.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Powering Dawg paddlers<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">For the past two years, the generosity of donors has made it possible for the UW Concrete Canoe Team to participate in the national competition. <a href=\"http:\/\/students.washington.edu\/uwcanoe\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Learn more about supporting the team and their journey to Texas<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Alternative Spring Break","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/alternative-spring-break\/","tags":["arts-sciences","college-of-education","college-of-the-environment","giving","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"For UW students involved in the Pipeline Project, spring break means teaching in classrooms across Washington.

And why should we care about wildlife?\u201d This time the students pause, pondering possible answers. A student seated at a desk in the middle of the room raises her hand: \u201cBecause they live here in Brewster, too!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Powell and three of her peers trade tanning for teaching for a week each March, heading to the small town of Brewster, Washington, as part of the <span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"http:\/\/expd.washington.edu\/pipelineasb\">UW Pipeline Project\u2019s Alternative Spring Break<\/a>\u00a0<\/span>(ASB) program. Since 2001, more than 700 UW undergraduates have volunteered in schools across Washington state; this year, 60 Huskies spread out among 14 rural and tribal communities from the Olympic Peninsula to Eastern Washington.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In apple country, the pace of life is a little different. At any given time during the day, a few cars roll down Main Street before parking in front of mom-and-pop shops, while children play near the banks of the Columbia River. \u201cBrewster is very rural, and I knew that the students didn\u2019t have a lot of opportunities to leave the community and see the rest of the world,\u201d explains Lupe Ledesma, a former counselor at Brewster High School. \u201cSo through ASB, I thought we could bring the world to them.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Situated at the confluence of the Columbia and Okanogan rivers in north central Washington, Brewster is surrounded by rolling hills and acres of apple orchards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Many migrant workers moved to the area, and today about 72 percent of the town\u2019s 2,300 residents are Latino. The kids from the migrant families are inquisitive and motivated, with dreams of becoming marine biologists, chefs and veterinarians. And through ASB, the UW students bolster the belief that they can make those dreams a reality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Utilizing a mix of classroom lessons, small group discussions and outdoor activities (the clear favorite), the UW students spent the week teaching the sixth graders about environmental science. This year, the curriculum was based on the theme \u201cThe land we live in,\u201d pertaining to the natural habitat in Brewster.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While the lessons aim to instill an interest in science, their teacher, Susan Varrelman, says that the most meaningful part of the week is the one-on-one interactions between her students and the undergraduates. \u201cThey\u2019re very high-achieving kids, who vocalize their interests already,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving the UW students here to talk with them is great to help them start thinking about how they can achieve those goals.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This year, the UW students also served the larger Brewster community by volunteering at the local Boys &amp; Girls Club and helping students\u2019 parents prepare for the U.S. citizenship test. \u201cComing back here each year and experiencing what\u2019s new, like this citizenship class, is great,\u201d says Powell. \u201cI love getting to build on the community connections I\u2019ve made in past years, while making new connections with our current class. Those are the reasons I keep coming back here with ASB.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Thirty miles north of Brewster, in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains, is the town of Omak, where another group of ASB volunteers work with students at <span class=\"s3\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.psischiefs.org\/\">Paschal Sherman Indian School<\/a>\u00a0<\/span>(PSIS). Tucked away in the dry forests overlooking the town, the UW students keep time with the kids.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While the Brewster group curated a science-based curriculum, the UW students at PSIS bring a literacy arts lesson plan. Over the course of the week, they help fourth through eighth graders write, illustrate and bind books along the theme \u201cThere\u2019s no place like home.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For PSIS students, home is the Colville Indian Reservation. Twelve American Indian and Alaska Native tribes \u2014 known collectively as the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation \u2014 reside on the land, and the school is infused with their culture and traditions, including lessons in Interior Salish, the regional American Indian language.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The week in Omak flies by in a flurry of glue sticks, markers and construction paper, and by Friday, colorful books cover the dorm where the UW students stay. The program culminates in a celebration, where students proudly read their completed books aloud to classmates and teachers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The books include illustrations of iconic Omak features, from the shores of Omak Lake to scenes of the Omak Stampede, and dedications go out to parents, siblings and close friends. Fifth grade teacher Larry Witt began keeping a \u201clibrary\u201d of the books over the years, where current and even past students return to re-read their work. \u201cThe kids take such pride in their books,\u201d he says. \u201cThey fondly remember the project, and hold those books dear.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Omak was one of the first four towns to host ASB, and Witt \u2014 who\u2019s been at PSIS for 42 years, and, incidentally, began his career as a collegiate volunteer \u2014 has worked with each UW cohort. From a learning perspective, he\u2019s thrilled by the possibilities ASB creates for each UW volunteer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIn the course of a week, you watch someone realize that they\u2019re important in a kid\u2019s life, that they\u2019re making an impact in a kid\u2019s life,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful to watch them be motivated and see the growth that occurs in just a week\u2019s time.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019d never really experienced American Indian culture before,\u201d says UW junior Jennie Cockrel. \u201cGetting to be in this community for a week opened me up to that culture\u2019s strengths.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Before Cockrel, a social work major, went to Omak with ASB, she\u2019d compared different areas of her field to specialize in. But after spending time with the classes and community members, a door opened: \u201cI started to really consider working with American Indian and Alaska Native populations and child welfare when I graduate,\u201d she says. \u201cThis definitely provided an experience to build on from here.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Over the years, Christine Stickler, director of the Pipeline Project, has heard countless stories of success: There\u2019s the student from Neah Bay who was inspired to become a teacher by ASB volunteers. After earning his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees at the UW, he\u2019s now a second-grade teacher in back in his hometown. There\u2019s the young girl from Harrah, who was told she could go to college for the first time by a UW student. Today, she\u2019s a UW undergraduate, and has been involved with ASB since her freshman year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Looking to the future, Stickler hopes to expand the ASB curriculum beyond environmental science and literacy arts to include other disciplines. She also plans to extend the program into a year-long experience; UW students would meet with a class at the start of school, keep in touch throughout the year, head back to the class for spring break, and finally bring the young students to the UW campus in June.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Stickler emphasizes that while the program is a tremendous experience for UW students, the heart of ASB is forming meaningful connections across Washington state. \u201cI\u2019ve seen how powerful the impact has been on both sides,\u201d she says. ASB actively changes schools and communities, agrees Ledesma, \u201cand it truly breaks down barriers between different cultures.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Interested in learning more about Alternative Spring Break?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s4\"><a href=\"http:\/\/expd.washington.edu\/pipelineasb\"><b>LEARN MORE<\/b><b><\/b><\/a><\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Engineering student success through STARS","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/engineering-student-success-through-stars\/","tags":["engineering","faculty","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good","student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"The Washington STate Academic RedShirt (STARS) program is making waves college-wide by setting students up for boundless opportunities in engineering. And it's only in its third year. What's next?","content":"(College of Engineering, May 2016)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When asked why he decided to study engineering, Jorge Gomez answers in one word: dams. As a kid growing up in Tri-Cities, Washington, he'd go camping along the Columbia River, and he became fascinated with the way dams worked. When he discovered that engineers brought together nature and technology to produce energy through dams, Gomez decided he wanted to be an engineer. The UW had a strong engineering school, so he set his sights on becoming a Husky.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He was both excited and anxious. The first in his family to attend college, Gomez wanted to set a positive example for his younger siblings, but he didn\u2019t want to be apart from them. His parents, though supportive of his education, depended heavily on him at home. \"I'm not going to lie, I initially feared coming to the UW because I would have to leave my family,\" he says. Additionally, he didn't know who to ask for advice on transitioning to college life. He'd received decent grades in high school but he worried that he wasn't academically prepared to compete with other engineering students.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\"Luckily I found STARS,\" says Gomez, who is finishing his first year. \"If it weren\u2019t for STARS, I probably wouldn\u2019t still be a student here.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gomez is one of 75 students enrolled at the UW through STARS, a program designed to increase the number of students from economically- and educationally-disadvantaged backgrounds who graduate with UW engineering degrees by providing a strong foundation through extra academic support, mentoring and funding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Historically, fewer than half of the students who enter the UW intending to study engineering complete engineering degrees. The success rate is nearly 20% lower for students from low-income and underserved communities. Often, these students have difficulty gaining admission to engineering departments due to inadequate high school preparation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Even students who earn As in high school aren\u2019t necessarily prepared for the difficulty of college-level classes. Many become discouraged and turn away from engineering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Access: A social justice issue<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\"It is a social justice issue that economically and educationally-disadvantaged students be given every opportunity to pursue high-value UW degrees, such as those offered by the College of Engineering,\" says Eve Riskin, a professor in electrical engineering and the College's associate dean for diversity and access. In collaboration with colleagues at the UW and Washington State University, Riskin secured a grant from the National Science Foundation in 2013 to implement STARS, originally modeled after University of Colorado-Boulder\u2019s Engineering GoldShirt Program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One of several access programs offered by the College, STARS focuses on building academic skills, providing students with a supportive community and educating them about the different types of engineering paths to find the right fit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>An academic \"redshirt year\"<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To think in terms of college athletics, STARS offers participating students a \"redshirt year:\" students spend five years at the UW, using the first year to develop the skills they'll need to succeed in engineering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At the UW, 32 incoming freshmen are invited to participate annually. Entry into the program isn\u2019t based solely on academic performance, as STARS program director Sonya Cunningham explains, \"It's not just about how smart you are but how hard you're willing to work.\" Students must tackle a workload drastically different than high school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">First-year STARS student Donavan Erickson can attest to this: \"Nothing in high school prepared me for the amount of time and energy that it takes to do well at the UW, and I\u2019m so thankful for the foundation in these areas that STARS is giving me.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In many underserved high schools, classes like calculus, chemistry and physics may not be offered, and when they are, they\u2019re not usually at the same level of rigor as similar courses taught elsewhere. As a result, students may do well but aren\u2019t prepared. Cunningham explains, \"Students who scored high by memorizing facts and formulas still need to develop different skills to be successful\u2014namely problem-solving and critical thinking.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Students develop study skills through regular meetings with STARS advisers, participation in study groups and by spending time at the UW's Engineering Academic Center. They take classes together as a cohort and look to each other for support. STARS students are required to live on-campus their first two years and are placed in the same residence halls.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\"STARS makes a large, intimidating place like the UW seem small, accessible and encouraging,\" says Gomez.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For Erickson, the STARS community makes all the difference. \"I'm closer to my peers, closer to campus resources like the engineering, math and writing centers, and I have a network of people that I can ask when I need help,\" he explains.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Together, undaunted<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Only in its third year, STARS is reporting positive impact in terms of student retention and performance. Overall, STARS students have achieved higher GPAs and performed better in their math and science courses relative to students who were eligible for STARS but didn't participate. And 83% of them have been retained in engineering to their sophomore year, compared to just 53% eligible but non-participating students. STARS students are also significantly more familiar with student resources on campus, such as academic help desks, centers and faculty office hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The program's impact is rippling through the College. Since STARS began, enrollment of under-represented minority students has increased by 93.5% while overall enrollment in the College has increased by 30.5%. Classrooms are more diverse, Riskin says, which means students of all backgrounds are better prepared to enter an increasingly diverse work environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Both Riskin and Cunningham would like to accommodate more students in STARS, but to do so will require additional staff, resources and scholarship funding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But they're thrilled with the program's success so far. Dedication is what drives the program, they say \u2014 dedication from students, staff, faculty and the College. Cunningham adds that one of the most exciting aspects of STARS is continually observing how well students do when expectations are set high. \"We see it with each new cohort \u2014 with guidance, structure and support, students will rise to the challenges set before them,\" she says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Students feel that dedication, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\"Care is at the core of STARS,\" explains Gomez.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">STARS students who have fulfilled program requirements by the end of their first year are guaranteed a spot in one of the UW's engineering programs. Both Gomez and Erickson hope to pursue electrical engineering and feel they are much better positioned to succeed in it than they would have been without STARS.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\"When I came to the UW, I was one person, and now, thanks to STARS, I\u2019m a very different person \u2014 more focused, more conscious, more engaged, more prepared,\" Erickson says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Learn more at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.engr.uw.edu\/current\/stars\"><span class=\"s3\">The STARS Program\u00a0\u00bb<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Finding meaning behind the music","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/finding-meaning-behind-the-music\/","tags":["faculty","tacoma"],"pillars":["innovation","student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Online tool helps students at UW Tacoma get creative with final class presentations.","content":"(Trends and Issues in Higher Ed, May 2016)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Last fall, UW Tacoma Lecturer Kim Davenport turned to <a href=\"https:\/\/fold.cm\/read\/FOLD\/what-is-fold-TiyWEK6C\"><span class=\"s2\">FOLD<\/span><\/a>, a new web-based open publishing platform, to help her students construct multimedia presentations that allow them to discover their creative voice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">FOLD, as Davenport quickly discovered, boosted the learning of the students in her humanities classes, encouraging them to express their ideas about music in multiple ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt brought out a lot of creativity in my students. And it made them better presenters,\u2019\u2019 says Davenport, a lecturer in Interdisciplinary Arts &amp; Sciences who first asked students to use FOLD for their final presentations last autumn quarter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cMany of the presentations are very touching, from a student who is contending with life after military service to someone who explored his world of sound by making a potato clarinet,\u201d says Davenport, who also was pleased by the high quality of content students produced, including the original musical pieces they performed for classmates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Technology offers students new options to apply theories and demonstrate understanding<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Students are now required to use FOLD to produce their final assignment in Davenport\u2019s course, <i>Listening Outside the Box: Concert Music in the 21st Century<\/i>. Before, Davenport asked students to write a two-page paper.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Writing about music is no easy task, says Davenport, even for seasoned musicians. FOLD makes it easier for students\u2014many who have no music experience at all\u2014to design, create, document and perform a new musical work as part of their final class presentation. With FOLD, they can attach videos, song snippets, photos and other multimedia to their words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI have been using FOLD for three quarters now, and it has really reinvigorated the final assignment,\u201d Davenport says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Studying\u2014and emulating\u2014an artist to boost your own creativity<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Davenport\u2019s class is centered on the musical philosophies of John Cage, considered one of the most influential composers of the 20<\/span><span class=\"s3\">th<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> century. Cage pioneered the idea of \u201cindeterminacy\u201d in music\u2014where any part of a musical composition is \u201cindeterminate\u201d if its performance is not precisely specified in the notation, allowing the performer to play at random or within certain guidelines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This approach also typically features non-standard use of musical instruments or even everyday objects, such as what is seen in the musical <i>Stomp<\/i> and by the Blue Man Group live musical act. Students learn about Cage, the meaning and philosophy of music, and, finally, are asked to create and perform a new musical work in homage to Cage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Davenport says Cage\u2019s ideas about music are particularly important\u2014and accessible\u2014for students who are looking at music critically for the first time. His unique ideas and creative approaches, which often push the boundaries of what is traditionally considered music, encourage students to expand their own views about music.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Following in Cage\u2019s footsteps, many of Davenport\u2019s students push the boundaries in their presentations, creating original video to play their scores and using a wide range of media to support their ideas and inspiration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Students learn how creative inspiration comes from anywhere, from the kitchen to Snapchat<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">FOLD, developed at the MIT Media Lab\u2019s Center for Civic Media in 2015, lets users link media \u201ccards\u201d to the text of their stories. These cards can include content in just about any digital form, from unique and fresh multimedia content created by the users to videos, photos, maps, tweets, audio and other links that already exist on the internet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For\u00a0an example, Davenport sends her students to look at <a href=\"https:\/\/fold.cm\/read\/pkangarooooo\/linstrument-de-la-terre-v65y3vCk\"><span class=\"s2\">L\u2019instrument de la Terre<\/span><\/a>, created by student Paul Kang, who made a potato clarinet for his final class assignment. Kang talks about his inspiration in his FOLD presentation, which is peppered with video, photos and music.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI chose to make a potato clarinet to show that you can make music with anything if you have the passion and the dedication like John Cage,\u201d writes Kang, who carved a potato and used clarinet parts to make his instrument.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Another student found his inspiration from social media. \u201cMy motivation to do this piece came from my constant Snapchat use,\u201d writes Ariel Advincula. \u201cI realized I posted a lot of snippets of my life on my Snapchat and if I skipped, stopped and replayed the footage in sporadic patterns, I found that even the simplest of sounds can become music.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Students have the option of keeping their projects online, Davenport says, something she encourages so others can enjoy and learn from their work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m always trying to find ways to make music more engaging for students. Some of my students have no musical skills, and I want to empower them to find their own voices by creating music and sharing those experiences with others.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Davenport\u2019s suggestions for incorporating FOLD into a class project:<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>If you\u2019re going to use a new classroom technology, try it out first, see if it fits: <\/b>Technologies come and go and that\u2019s true for classroom use, Davenport says, so be open to new tools that can help you meet your teaching and learning goals. Davenport learned about FOLD last summer, when she used it to make a <a href=\"https:\/\/fold.cm\/read\/DestinyInFocus\/tarts-220-exploring-classical-music-in-our-community-EXaFHiAu\"><span class=\"s2\">submission<\/span><\/a> of her classroom work for a music award. She tried it and saw its potential to help students.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">FOLD is relatively new and free for now, but Davenport recommends it because her experience over three quarters has been largely positive\u2014students have reacted well to it and have used it in creative ways to support their work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, as easy as it is to use, she says faculty should definitely try out any new classroom technology first before asking students to work with it. \u201cI learned how to use it very quickly, and students should not have any problems at all,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u201cStudents live online, so this is easy for them.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Make it a requirement:<\/b> At first, using FOLD was not required, but consistency in a classroom is important, she says. Now, students know they will be using FOLD to create and present their final project\u2014worth 30 percent of their grade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Help students understand how to use the classroom technology and how it fits into their experience of learning about creativity:<\/b> Davenport spends time with students explaining how they will use the publishing platform.

Boand Endowed Professor of Chemistry at the UW. \u201cBut all the chemicals that make up most of the things we use every day, including plastics, pharmaceuticals, shampoos, detergents, paints, and more are also currently obtained from the same oil, using chemistry that was developed in the middle of the last century. We\u2019re working on new ways to make these same chemicals, but starting with other sources like carbon dioxide or methane.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The chemistry is anything but simple \u2014 processes like alkane dehydrogenation and ester hydrogenation are involved \u2014 but after touring CENTC\u2019s labs and talking with Smoll and Culakova, PSC\u2019s exhibit staff was able to translate the work for a lay audience. \u201cIt was crazy to see how much they were able to simplify our research, turning it into something the public could understand,\u201d says Smoll, who is featured in videos in the exhibit along with fellow grad student Travis Lekich and alumna Sophia Cherry (PhD, Chemistry, 2016).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">PSC created kid-friendly interactive displays, most notably a glove box similar to the ones\u00a0scientists use to work with chemicals in an oxygen-free and water-free environment.\u00a0 The apparatus gets its name from the built-in gloves used for handling materials in the box. PSC visitors quickly learn what chemists already know: the gloves are challenging to use. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s like wearing mittens all the time,\u201d says Smoll. \u201cYour dexterity is completely gone.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Exhibit visitors can also create \u2014 virtually\u00a0\u2014 chemicals used in common materials, thanks to a touch-screen game developed by a team that included former CENTC graduate student David Laviska and former postdoctoral fellow Abby O\u2019Connor.\u00a0 At the side of the game are outlines of elements, each with a distinct shape. When a corresponding element scrolls past on the screen, the player drags it into the outline. Once all the outlines are filled, the screen reveals the chemical that has been created and how it is used, from clothing to plastic bottles.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And the lab notebook and peanut butter? Those are in displays showing the contents of the grad students\u2019\u00a0work spaces, from their research tools to their afternoon snacks. Culakova was amused to learn that her lab notebook was open to a page with scribbled notes and a hand-drawn diagram. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone reading your to-do list,\u201d she says. \u201cMy notebook reveals the untidy human side of research, which is the day-to-day reality.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Culakova and Smoll have participated in previous science outreach at Seattle\u2019s Roosevelt High School and at annual PSC Paws on Science events featuring UW research.

Meanwhile, we\u2019re taking our liberal arts programs apart.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The event organizers had no illusions that the Ideathon would magically solve this growing problem, but they saw value in having undergraduates bring their perspectives and creative thinking to the issue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The weekend was structured to encourage collaboration and exploration. The students worked in teams, each with a mix of majors, genders, nationalities, and personality types (based on the Myers-Briggs personality test). Friday night, each team developed interview questions and asked them of each other and other students on campus. Saturday they conducted more interviews, this time with faculty and academic advisers, to assess the current state of the humanities. They looked for commonalities in the responses, which led to more questions and more interviews and sparked ideas for promoting the humanities.\u00a0\u00a0Late Saturday afternoon, the teams ran their ideas past faculty, staff, and administrators \u2014 and discovered that many of their proposals were not viable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That\u2019s when a student scribbled the plaintive question, \u201cWhy is this problem so hard?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mihata was not surprised by the sentiment. \u201cWe knew that would happen,\u201d he says. \u201cWe warned them that they would be frustrated and tired and wondering why they were doing this, and that there wouldn\u2019t seem to be a solution. I took that question as a good sign, actually, that the students recognized that it was a hard and complicated problem. Because real Sophomore Miki Saito remembers her team hitting rock bottom on Saturday night, and how they eventually recovered. \u201cIt was the most meaningful part of the weekend for me,\u201d she says. \u201cFor part of the night, my group felt like we had no idea where we were going and like we had hit a wall. We took a small break and then did a run-through of our presentation and worked it out. We were really proud of each other in the end.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI have never had the chance to have a real conversation\/debate with people who have the power to change things,\u201d says Ji Li, a senior majoring in economics and mathematics. \u201cIt really opened my eyes as to how new ideas can be formed and\u2026examined in a very professional setting.\u201d Adds freshman Justin Johnson, \u201cIt was awesome to get to engage with the faculty on such a high level of thinking. They were interesting, thoughtful, and intelligent.\u201dOn Sunday, each team presented its findings to a panel of six faculty and administrators \u2014 including Dean Stacey and Michael Shapiro, divisional dean for the humanities \u2014 with the panel then choosing one winning Ideathon team. The presentations involved considerable give-and-take, as both the students and panel members asked and answered questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The teams shared observations with the panel, based on their weekend research; some also presented proposals for increasing engagement in the humanities. One team suggested sharing available data about the abundance of CEOs with humanities degrees, to counter students\u2019 employment concerns. Another team suggested linking one-credit humanities courses to STEM courses where there is overlapping content. Others proposed developing \u201cinterest tracks\u201d that bundle courses that reinforce each, or course sequences like those found in the sciences \u2014 something the Humanities Division had begun to explore prior to the Ideathon. The winning team proposed a Pandora-like tool to recommend humanities courses based on individual preferences.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Whether any of these suggestions are realized, Stacey considers the Ideathon a success. \u201cWe had no expectation that they would solve this problem for us over one weekend,\u201d says Stacey. \u201cBut it was clear that their understanding of the problem was significantly deeper at the end than when they began, their solutions were more complex, and there are things that came out of the Ideathon that I do think we can think hard about.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Jandhyala and Mihata see tremendous value in the Ideathon as a learning tool, and hope to offer the workshops with some regularity, posing different questions each time. \u201cI think of this as a long-term partnership,\u201d says Jandhyala. \u201cThis is just a first step.\u201d<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"A tailored approach to trauma intervention","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/a-tailored-approach-to-trauma-intervention\/","tags":["arts-sciences","faculty"],"pillars":["public-good","impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"Working with Somali community leaders, a UW psychology professor has developed\u00a0a\u00a0trauma intervention program\u00a0for the\u00a0Somali community.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, May 2016)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Thousands of Somali refugees have moved to Seattle in search of opportunity and security. Many, haunted by their past, suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related problems. A new program developed by UW <a href=\"http:\/\/www.psych.uw.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">psychology <\/span><\/a>professor Lori Zoellner and Duniya Lang, founder and director of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/somalireconciliation\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Somali Reconciliation Institute <\/span><\/a>(SRI), provides a trauma-focused intervention tailored for the Somali community. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Whether trauma is caused by a sexual assault, natural disaster, or war atrocities, PTSD symptoms tend to be consistent across populations. They include avoidance of potential reminders of the trauma and episodes of re-experiencing the event through nightmares and other disturbing images. Traditional treatment involves up to a dozen one-on-one sessions with a skilled therapist. \u201cAfter short-term interventions, people often maintain their gains for many years,\u201d says Zoellner, who specializes in PTSD research. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So why not offer existing therapies to Somalis with PTSD? \u201cWe felt that individual psychotherapy probably wasn\u2019t the best approach, given their emphasis on community,\u201d says Zoellner, \u201cand that with a good portion of the Somali community identifying as Muslim, having a program that was embedded in the faith would be critical for success.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lang approached Zoellner to help develop an empirically supported intervention for Somalis suffering in the aftermath of war-torn conflict.\u00a0 The result is a six-week PTSD program \u2014\u00a0<i>Islahul Qulub: Islamic Trauma Healing\u00a0<\/i>\u2014\u00a0that combines prayer, prophet narratives, and guided discussion. Sessions are led by members of the community trained as lay leaders, with separate groups offered for men and women.\u00a0 Dr. Sheikh Ahmed Nuur, the Imam at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.abubakrislamiccenter.com\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Abu-Bakr Islamic Center<\/span><\/a> in Seattle, agreed to host the program at the mosque and reviewed the program manual to ensure religious integrity. He even wrote supplications to bookend each group session.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cEarly on it became really clear to us that if this was going to work, it had to be endorsed by the Imam and had to be embedded within the mosque,\u201d says Zoellner. \u201cDuniya worked quite hard to make that happen. We knew there would be some degree of concern or suspicion if the program was done anywhere else.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Even with the mosque\u2019s approval, adapting individual psychotherapy to a group setting was no small challenge. Much PTSD therapy addresses re-experiencing and avoidance by having people talk about their trauma event repeatedly. But in groups, sharing stories can lead to comparisons about whose trauma is worse, or can increase stress at hearing more atrocities described.\u00a0 Zoellner and Lang solved this by having participants pray to Allah privately about their trauma experience and then discuss their prayer experience with the rest of the group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThey pray to Allah about what happened, how it happened, and how it affected them,\u201d says Zoellner. \u201cWith the group, they talk about their experience of prayer with Allah but not about the trauma event itself.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While the prayer to Allah addresses re-experiencing and avoidance, prophet narratives help with \u201ccognitive restructuring,\u201d or getting people to think differently about their traumatic experiences. Each week the lay leaders share the story of a prophet, then pose carefully worded questions to encourage discussion. After reading about Job, for example, they ask the group about Job\u2019s life before and after his afflictions, and about the role of suffering in faith.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThrough these stories, the group sees how other people have moved through suffering,\u201d says Zoellner. \u201cThe narratives shift over six weeks. First they focus on what we learn through suffering, then how we overcome suffering, then how we reconcile with ourselves, others, Allah, and the community.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The prayers to Allah change along with the prophet narratives.\u00a0 In the final session, after discussing a prophet narrative about reconciliation, the participants pray to Allah about being thankful for the trials they have been given and what they have learned from those trials. \u201cIt takes what we know are the empirically supported principles of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral treatment and puts them in the context of a group format that has faith as an integral part,\u201d says Zoellner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">All of the prophet narratives, questions, and prayer prompts are included in a manual that Zoellner and Lang developed with the help of UW postdoctoral scholar Belinda Graham, psychology doctoral student Libby Marks, and professor Norah Feeny at Case Western Reserve University. The lay leaders, trained by the team, use the manual to guide discussion. Those leaders will help train future lay leaders, with the goal of a self-sustaining program within the Somali community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A small pilot of the program, completed in March, was well received. \u00a0Zoellner and Lang are eager to expand the pilot and run a randomized control trial to demonstrate the program\u2019s effectiveness. Lang is so optimistic that she reached out to Somali\u2019s former prime minister about introducing the program in Somalia. The prime minister visited the UW to discuss the project and has pledged his support.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo other PTSD treatments have an Islamic focus, despite approximately 23 percent of the world\u2019s population practicing this religion,\u201d says Zoellner. \u201cThat, plus the individual nature of most PTSD therapy, have been significant barriers to dissemination of these effective therapies. What has been most encouraging about this project has been how enthusiastic the group members and lay leaders have been. They see it as a way that they can make change. It\u2019s exciting to see how well it seems to fit their needs.\u201d<\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Celebrating the U-District, dramatically","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/celebrating-the-u-district-dramatically\/","tags":["alumni","arts-sciences","faculty","graduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good","student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"For the Skies Over Seattle project, drama students\u00a0are devising original theater pieces inspired by community organizations in the U-District.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, May 2016)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">AJ Friday rarely ventured into Seattle\u2019s University District during his first year at the UW. As a student in the School of Drama\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/drama.washington.edu\/professional-actor-training-program-patp\"><span class=\"s2\">Professional Actor Training Program<\/span><\/a> (PATP), he was too busy with coursework and rehearsals to spend time exploring the surrounding neighborhood. That changed last fall, when he and about two dozen other drama students began work on Skies Over Seattle, an ambitious year-long theater project that connects the campus and surrounding community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Skies Over Seattle combines volunteerism and artistic creation. The students \u2014 graduate students in acting, design, and directing, as well as several undergraduates \u2014 began the project by volunteering regularly for three community organizations in the University District, then devising original theater pieces inspired by the people they\u2019d met as volunteers. Visiting artists Katie Pearl (BA, Drama, 1996) and Lisa D\u2019Amour \u2014 the OBIE-winning duo behind\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/pearldamour.com\/\"><span class=\"s2\">PearlDamour<\/span><\/a>\u00a0\u2014 and engagement strategist Ashley Sparks have guided the creative process from the start.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThis has been one of the biggest projects ever in the history of the School of Drama,\u201d says Scott Magelssen, associate professor of drama and a faculty adviser for Skies Over Seattle. \u201cThe artistic challenge is finding a way to be authentic to the communities, to create art that comes from grassroots experience.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The participating organizations are local nonprofits providing much-needed social services: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eghseattle.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Elizabeth Gregory Home<\/span><\/a>(EGH), which provides transitional housing, a day center, and other services for homeless and at-risk women; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.peoplesharmreductionalliance.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\">The People\u2019s Harm Reduction Alliance<\/span><\/a> (PHRA), a peer-run organization that promotes the philosophy of harm reduction and safer drug use; and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rootsinfo.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\">ROOTS Young Adult Shelter<\/span><\/a>, where young adults experiencing homelessness can find essential services and a safe place to sleep. \u201cAs volunteers, we were all in learning mode, establishing bonds with people where we were volunteering,\u201d says Friday, a co-director of the group working with PHRA. \u201cUW aside, we were there for them. We wanted to establish a relationship on <i>their<\/i> terms.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">ROOTS executive director Kristine Cunningham appreciated that attitude. \u201cAs a nonprofit across the street from the UW, ROOTS has had student projects galore,\u201d Cunningham says. \u201cSome have been wonderful, some have left us feeling like lab rats. But the students from the School of Drama have been different from the start. They arrived with a palpable openness to the experience that is our shelter. Because they have invested real time as volunteers to build their performance, it\u2019s going to be good.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">PATP student Tamsen Glaser certainly hopes so. Spending time at ROOTS, she found the young adults there very willing to talk, and looks forward to celebrating their lives through performance.\u00a0 \u201cThey are confident in who they are,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are not ashamed or afraid. That\u2019s what ended up fueling our piece \u2014 the people we met.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The desire to capture the spirit of the community partners both inspired and weighed heavily on the UW students as they began building their pieces. \u201cMy group floundered for a time,\u201d Glaser recalls. \u201cWe were scared of misrepresenting or making a 2-D caricature of things that were so much more rich and beautiful than what we could ever put into a performance.\u201d The open-ended nature of the project was also a challenge. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how not having any boundaries is unbelievably constricting,\u201d Glaser says. \u201cThere\u2019s the feeling, \u2018Oh, I have so much freedom. What am I going to do?\u2019\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Katie Pearl says those roadblocks are to be expected, and are addressed in the Skies Over Seattle workshops that PearlDamour and Sparks led several times during the year. \u00a0\u201cOne of the tools we bring in and really stay with is learning to be comfortable wandering around in the unknown, stumbling around in the dark,\u201d says Pearl. \u201cFaculty have mentioned that they appreciate that aspect of this project, because that is not part of professional actor training.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Pearl should know, having majored in drama as a UW undergraduate 20 years ago. She began doing experimental work while studying at the University, including a site-specific piece performed by undergraduate and graduate actors in a squash court at the Intramural Activities Building. \u201cI was able to try low stakes, high energy experiments at the UW,\u201d Pearl recalls. \u201cAll the things that started bubbling back then have led to what I\u2019ve done since. I feel a lot of gratitude toward the School of Drama, so it makes me excited to come back and give students an experience that may open things up for them in the way that things opened up for me when I was here.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">From the start, the visiting artists made it clear that Skies Over Seattle was not intended to represent the community organizations in a naturalistic way.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not about playing a homeless person or imitating someone\u2019s speech,\u201d says D\u2019Amour. \u201cThat\u2019s not the core of the experiment. It\u2019s more about reflecting back. And we\u2019re challenging the students to use some kind of experimental aesthetic.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">True to that challenge, none of the three groups will present a traditional narrative play, though there will be narrative elements in each. The ROOTS group, which happens to be musically inclined, will weave original compositions through its piece, which loosely follows the journey of a ROOTS guest from night into morning. The PHRA group is planning a carnival theme, reflecting PHRA\u2019s desire that the piece be fun and entertaining. It will include stories \u2014 some abstracted, some nearly verbatim \u2014 that PHRA clients have shared with the UW students. (Anonymity will be preserved.) The EGH group\u2019s piece will combine improvisation, projections, and scripted scenes, with a nod to superheroes. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Why the superheroes? \u201cA team member was volunteering [at EGH] and overheard a woman talking about watching Xena, Warrior Princess on TV,\u201d explains PATP student Tatiana Pavela. \u201cAnother woman responded, \u2018Honey, we are all warrior princesses.\u2019 That made us think of the superhuman strength required of these women just to get through the day, find a meal, and be able to sleep safely.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In late May, the students will perform their finished pieces for their community organizations. Then Pearl and Sparks will work with the students to weave the three pieces together for public performances at Jones Playhouse from June\u00a03 - 5 (see sidebar).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The students look forward to the Playhouse shows, but the performances that are likely to mean the most are those performed for the community organizations they have come to know so well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe hope for us is that they feel as though they have been seen and heard,\u201d says Glaser. Adds Friday, \u201cWe want the community to know that we\u2019re not <i>giving<\/i> them a voice \u2014 they already <i>have<\/i> a voice.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">.\u00a0 .\u00a0 .\u00a0 .<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>This project was made possible in part with support from the Floyd U.

Students are well-versed in the concepts of outbreak investigations, but they lack practical experience, according to Baseman. Instead, she says, graduate school programs tend to focus on research.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After four weeks of classroom training and at-home assignments, students will be ready to help the Washington State Department of Health and local public health agencies as budding \u201cdisease detectives.\u201d They\u2019ll interview patients and others exposed to a disease, collect and analyze data, and help with emergency preparedness and response activities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting a course like this since I was a student, but it never existed,\u201d said Baseman, an associate professor of epidemiology and an adjunct associate professor of health services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Baseman earned her PhD (\u201905) in epidemiology from the UW, but didn\u2019t get hands-on experience until after graduation.

Students will review key concepts of an outbreak investigation, such as communicating with stakeholders, protecting the privacy of people, and designing surveys or questionnaires to track a disease. They will also practice mock interviews. Later in the quarter, they\u2019ll sign up for field assignments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the summer \u2013 a busy time for outbreaks such as food-borne illnesses \u2013 SEAL team members will take part in more field assignments.

As a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cies.org\/\">Fulbright\u00a0Scholar<\/a>, Zaslavky\u2019s commitment to healthy aging earned him\u00a0an excellent reputation among the UW School of Nursing\u2019s\u00a0many aging experts.\n\n\u201cWe have partnered with the UW School of Nursing for more\u00a0than two decades and watched their commitment to research\u00a0and science of healthy aging grow,\u201d Almo said.\u00a0\u201cWe knew that Dr. Zaslavsky\u2019s research would complement\u00a0the research already occurring, and that his worldview\u00a0and experience would bring a fresh voice for teaching and\u00a0mentoring to the school.\u201d\n\nZaslavsky\u2019s scholarship focuses on prevention and\u00a0improving clinical outcomes in older persons with frailty.\u00a0He is the newest member of the <a href=\"https:\/\/nursing.uw.edu\/research\/programs\/de-tornyay-center\/\">de Tornyay Center<\/a>.\n\n\u201cMy hope is to promote functional independence so that\u00a0people can enjoy their lives to the fullest extent as they age,\u201d\u00a0Zaslavsky said.\u00a0\u201cJoining the University of Washington School of Nursing and\u00a0deTornyay Center for Healthy Aging is a dream come true for\u00a0me. The intellectual community here has been stimulating\u00a0my research on aging for many years and now I am thrilled to\u00a0become a part of this extraordinary interdisciplinary group.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am incredibly grateful to the Almos for making my\u00a0transition to the UW possible,\u201d he said."},{"title":"Technology for older adults","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/technology-for-older-adults\/","tags":["faculty","school-of-nursing"],"pillars":["innovation","student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Students inspired to explore the possibilities of technology in helping older adults maintain quality of life.","content":"(School of Nursing, March 2016)\n\nDr. <a href=\"https:\/\/nursing.uw.edu\/person\/george-demiris\/\">George Demiris<\/a>, the Alumni Endowed Professor in Nursing, inspires his students to explore the possibilities of technology in helping older adults maintain quality of life.

The system, placed\u00a0in a local memory-care unit, provides entertainment,\u00a0communication, information, reminiscence therapy, and\u00a0cognitive training. Most of the technology, whether software\u00a0or hardware, will be put to scrutiny through academic\u00a0research. Since 2013, the interdisciplinary team at HEALTH-E\u00a0has produced more than two dozen peer-reviewed\u00a0publications examining technology in aging.\n\nThe lab was recently highlighted in the July 2015 press\u00a0release for the White House Conference on Aging and\u00a0subsequently in an article for the Huffington Post.

Erin Stoy, BSN \u201905, DNP \u201917, sees the Emergency Department differently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Just a year after receiving her BSN from UW, Stoy moved\u00a0to Nogales, Arizona, a town on the Mexican border. She\u00a0worked in the Emergency \u00a0Department at Carondelet Holy\u00a0Cross hospital, located two miles from the wall, in 2007, the\u00a0year with the highest rate of illegal immigration in the past\u00a050 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Her patients were often so sick, Stoy said, that she \u201cdidn\u2019t\u00a0feel effective \u2026 people were hanging on by a thread.\u201d\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Regularly, she cared for people who had traveled hundreds\u00a0of miles by foot, women who labored outside of the\u00a0hospital so that they could birth their baby on American\u00a0soil, people nearly dying of dehydration and the constant\u00a0presence of border patrol guards, who would seek out\u00a0possible illegal immigrants as they departed the hospital.\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cSometimes I don\u2019t even know where to begin,\u201d Stoy said.\u00a0\u201cSometimes, we just have to start at the biggest hurt. I try\u00a0to educate \u2014 to acknowledge their issues \u2014 but I can\u2019t help\u00a0outside of these walls. We are just bandaging people. They\u00a0have so many issues.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Her experience in Nogales compelled her to return to UW\u00a0for her Doctor of Nursing Practice.\u00a0She decided she needed to start at the beginning, nurturing\u00a0health, instilling good habits and forming relationships so\u00a0that no patient of hers would find themselves at the end of\u00a0their rope.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Stoy recently worked at Valley Medical Center\u2019s Emergency\u00a0Department, in Renton. She sees that even Emergency\u00a0Departments located far away from the border have no\u00a0shortage of patients with complicated, chronic medical\u00a0conditions exacerbated \u2014\u00a0and often untreated \u2014\u00a0as a result\u00a0of socioeconomic factors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">These patients land in the Emergency Department when one\u00a0or more conditions spiral out of control. Stoy has learned\u00a0through experience that often the bandage, splint or IV can\u2019t\u00a0begin to address the issues that will send a person back\u00a0through the Emergency Department, time after time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Now she looks forward to becoming a nurse practitioner\u00a0and helping people, step-by-step, along their health\u00a0journey.

The videos are used in the \u201cIntroduction to Dental Public Health Sciences\u201d course, which familiarizes first-year dental students with public health concepts such as barriers to dental care, behavioral and social determinants of oral health, and the development of multi-level solutions to reduce oral health disparities. These are areas in which Chi has experienced issues firsthand in Alaska and in other communities as a researcher and dentist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Case studies play a central role in introducing students to real-life scenarios. It may show, for example, high numbers of cavities among children in an area where there\u2019s no fluoridated water but plenty of sugary drinks. Throughout his Alaska research, Chi met these children and their families, and saw how shocked and surprised parents were after realizing their children had been consuming 16 times the maximum amount of added sugars recommended for children.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThese case studies put dental health care in perspective. They allow students to follow a scenario, discuss barriers to health and potential solutions with their peers. But I thought we could do it better with video,\u201d Chi says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Chi returned to teach at the UW in 2010, when pedagogical approaches also were making a strong case for video in some circumstances. He wanted to see if videos could make the case study approach an even more powerful learning experience, and he started with a modest goal of three videos to test the waters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The videos piloted shortly after his arrival. One tells the story of a teenager of American Indian descent with mouth sores caused by tobacco products; another follows a non-English speaking pregnant woman frustrated by dental forms she can\u2019t understand; a third focuses on a Medicaid-enrolled preschooler with a non-English speaking mom. All three are still in use today, with six others now part of the dental library. Chi said there are plans to make more videos, including one that discusses dental problems faced by the homeless population.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m big on evidence-based teaching,\u201d says Chi, who co-authored a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/trends\/files\/2016\/03\/2014b-JDE-paper-vs-video-cases-in-DPH-course.pdf\"><span class=\"s2\">study comparing video vs. paper cases<\/span><\/a>. The data revealed that dental students who received a video case for study reported better affective, cognitive and overall learning outcomes than students who received a paper case. \u201cWe found significant statistical differences. Across all measures, the videos were much better at improving student outcomes.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Students who watched the videos reported a higher understanding of public health problems and how these issues might affect their own careers as dentists. Compared with students who studied from paper cases, the video students also had more empathy toward vulnerable individuals and a greater appreciation of how health disparities impacted real people, Chi says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\"><b>\u201c<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s4\"><b>When we made the videos, I didn\u2019t realize at first how powerful they were and how much they affected the thinking of so many students.\u201d<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Through visual storytelling, the individuals and their problems become more real to students\u2014some of whom have never even had a dental cavity. The videos, he says, lead to deeper, more empathetic thinking toward people dealing with health disparities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhen we made the videos, I didn\u2019t realize at first how powerful they were and how much they affected the thinking of so many students,\u2019\u2019 says Chi. \u201cMany were outraged by the situations they saw in the videos. They were affected in a very profound way.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Chi\u2019s suggestions for producing case study videos:<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Aim for quality over quantity:<\/b> Chi recommends starting small, and focusing on producing only one or two videos at first. Students are accustomed to technology, and savvy about video. They know if something is poorly made when they see it. Chi and colleagues narrowed their focus and chose three dental health topics that could be made into short, well-made videos.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Assemble a team and access UW support:<\/b> Chi suggests involving people with expertise in producing videos and not being afraid to ask for help. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/video\/our-services\/production\/\"><span class=\"s2\">UW Video<\/span><\/a> provides services to the entire University community; faculty can also tap hourly videographers or Communications grad students who are adept at visual storytelling and need a project. Chi says volunteer actors, film editors and videographers often need the practice and are happy to participate in this type of project. He recruited his sister, who had finished studying film at the UW, to direct and produce the videos. They worked together with a team of psychologists to craft the story and dialogue. Video expertise, from writing to filming to acquiring talent (actors), is more likely to produce positive results, with videos that will engage students.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">However, there are costs involved in producing high-quality video. Chi sought funding from multiple sources to support his project, putting together a business plan based on three pilot videos, and making a strong case for visual storytelling as a pedagogical tool. As evidence, he cited the Commission on Dental Accreditation, which encourages the use of technology such as video to enhance the educational experience of dental students while improving the learning environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Keep it short:<\/b> Students don\u2019t need one-hour videos. A typical video in the dental school is about 10 minutes long. That\u2019s plenty of time for a detailed narrative that won\u2019t overwhelm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Remember that video isn\u2019t a substitute for face-to-face teaching:<\/b> Video does not stand alone. In problem-based learning, video is another tool for learning. It is most effective when supplemented with group discussions led by a facilitator.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div id=\"text-29\" class=\"widget widget_text\">\n<h2 class=\"widgettitle\">WHAT STUDENTS SAID<\/h2>\n<div class=\"textwidget\">\n\n\u201cIt was a lot more realistic to have a video case as opposed to something on paper ... it helped to show that this type of case happens in everyday life.\u201d\n\n<hr \/>\n\n\u201cVisually seeing the case instead of reading [it] brought it to life.\"\n\n<hr \/>\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning to the end [it was] as though we were actually present with the patient.\"\n\n<hr \/>\n\n\u201cIf the case were to be read off a piece of paper, people might not take it as seriously or grasp the gravity of the situation.\"\n\nStudent quotes come from Chi's study comparing paper-based case studies versus video studies.\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"uw-widget-cards-81\" class=\"widget cards-widget\"><\/div>\n<h3><a class=\"pic-title\" href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/trends\/uw-school-of-dentistry#tips\">VIDEO CASE TIPS<\/a><\/h3>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Aim for quality over quantity<\/li>\n\t<li>Assemble a team<\/li>\n\t<li>Keep it short<\/li>\n\t<li>Use video as a supplemental teaching tool<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"p8\"><a class=\"pic-text-more uw-btn btn-sm btn-gold\" href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/trends\/uw-school-of-dentistry#tips\">LEARN MORE<\/a><\/p>\n\n<h3><a class=\"pic-title\" href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/trends\/video-helps-students-put-a-face-on-critical-dental-health-care-issues\/\">REAL PROBLEMS, REAL PEOPLE<\/a><\/h3>\nLearn about one dental student\u2019s experiences with video case studies.\n<p class=\"p8\"><a class=\"pic-text-more uw-btn btn-sm btn-gold\" href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/trends\/video-helps-students-put-a-face-on-critical-dental-health-care-issues\/\">READ MORE<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s4\"><b>Acknowledgments:<\/b> The original video idea stemmed from a collaboration among Chi and Drs. \u00a0Jacqueline Pickrell, lecturer in Oral Health Sciences at the UW, and Christine Riedy, now an instructor at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine.

After representing the U.S. at the 2012 Paralympics in London, Englert arrived in Seattle, where her first quarter was punctuated by interviews, photo shoots and even a first pitch at a Seattle Mariners game. Beyond the thrill of competing in the Paralympics, the stories captured something else: Englert\u2019s resilience, which led her to rowing and the UW.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In middle school, Englert was diagnosed with Stargardt disease, a degenerative eye condition that causes progressive damage to the retina. But that hasn\u2019t stopped her from competing in both national and world rowing championships as well as excelling at a number of other sports, including snowboarding and CrossFit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Accompanied by her attentive guide dog, Briggs, the graduating senior sat down to reflect on her time at the UW: rowing, life as a Husky and pushing past limits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>UW: How did you first get involved in rowing?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Englert: I first tried rowing my freshman year of high school, when I attended a National Federation of the Blind conference. At the conference, there was an erg machine competition, and I beat everyone there \u2014 even some Paralympic athletes \u2014 who then suggested I try rowing. I\u2019m kind of an oddity; there aren\u2019t many other blind people that are my height and athletic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">After that, I approached a local crew club, but they wouldn\u2019t bring me on because I was blind. So I just tried another team. On the first day, I went up to the coach and I told him that I\u2019m visually impaired and I wanted to row. He just said, \u201cGreat! You won\u2019t look out of the boat.\u201d He let me do everything; he even put me in a single \u2014 one person, rowing by herself. You wouldn\u2019t normally put the person who can\u2019t see in a single and send them off, but you know, I\u2019ve only hit one buoy, and some coxswains can\u2019t say that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Why did you choose to attend the University of Washington?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I chose the UW for the disability resources for students. When I was looking at colleges during high school, I found that some universities wouldn\u2019t even consider having Braille services. But here at the UW, the Disability Resources for Students staff hit every accommodation I might ever need to succeed. Additionally, I wanted high academics and high-level rowing, so it really was the perfect fit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The summer between high school and college, you competed in the 2012 Paralympic Games in London. Tell us about your experiences there.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">There were so many cool people I met. Since I\u2019d rowed the past couple of years, I got to see a lot of other athletes from different countries that I knew, and I loved being in the Olympic Village and watching events with them. After our racing was over, I stayed in London to watch the rest of the games and take part in the closing ceremonies. I got back right before I came to the UW, so I didn\u2019t even have time to pack my own bags for college, my mom had them ready to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">But honestly some of the best things to come out of London were the stories about Briggs. He has better stories than me! A camera crew met each team off the plane, and they ignored all the rowers and went straight for Briggs. He was definitely the star of the show.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>After the games, you got to go to the White House and meet President Obama. What was that like?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">They have really good cookies! Oatmeal. Originally, President Obama wasn\u2019t going to stay long, but he ended up hanging around and meeting everyone, shaking our hands. I even secretly took a selfie with him in the background that somehow lined up, since I couldn\u2019t actually see the screen. But Briggs was the real star. The president saw him and said, \u201cOh, who\u2019s our little friend?\u201d Briggs also got a belly rub from Michelle Obama.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>You\u2019ve rowed for the Huskies since you walked onto the team your freshman year. What do you think sets UW rowing apart?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I think what really sets us apart is our heart. I\u2019ve rowed with a lot of people, and I\u2019ve never been around such determined and driven athletes. We are a group of fighters who want to get better and push on every day. Every single person on the team works their butt off to push themselves and everyone around them. No spot is set or reserved, you have to fight constantly to earn your seat. We also know that we\u2019re more than athletes, and there is a huge amount of support for each other off the water.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">My favorite thing about the team is that we have fun, though. We\u2019re spunky and goofy and it\u2019s absolutely great. I\u2019m going to miss our pre-practice dance competitions and spontaneous cheers on the water. It\u2019s really hard to describe our team right now, but it\u2019s honestly the most passionate, competitive and supportive group of strong young women I have ever had the privilege to be with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What was your favorite race at Washington?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">One of my favorite races was my first race for the UW: the San Diego Crew Classic. I was in the freshman eight, and we won by 0.16 seconds. We went undefeated for the rest of the season. Our mentality was, \u201cWe\u2019re going to win, whatever it takes, and then we\u2019re going to win as much as we can.\u201d That points to how amazing the team is right now, because that mentality carried on through the years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The UW has a history of being open to walk-ons, so that freshman eight boat was pretty evenly split between new and experienced rowers. Despite our different experience levels, we all brought an unwavering mentality that we should win everything, and we did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>After you graduate in June, what\u2019s next?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019m majoring in information systems. It\u2019s a really exciting field with a lot of potential, and I actually just got into the Foster School of Business\u2019 Master of Science in Information Systems program, so I\u2019ll be sticking around for a bit longer, going to grad school and working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019ll keep watching UW crew races, but I probably won\u2019t come to practice. I\u2019ve been rowing for eight years, and I think it\u2019s time I retired. Through crew, I\u2019ve made some of the best friends of my life. My graduating class is really tight and goofy \u2014 very goofy \u2014 and we\u2019ve made it through a lot together, so it\u2019s bittersweet graduating and thinking I won\u2019t see them every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What would you say to other athletes with disabilities?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Failing\u2019s not the worst thing in the world; it\u2019s better to just try. The way I grew up, I didn\u2019t have many limits put on me. [Stargardt] was never made into a \u201cbig thing\u201d in my family. My parents would say, \u201cShe\u2019s a kid, let her go snowboarding, let her go mountain biking, just get a guide.\u201d That\u2019s something I was very lucky in; not everyone is fortunate to grow up in an environment like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019ve only ever felt limits other people have tried to put on me. I\u2019ve fallen into the trap of thinking to myself, \u201cWell if they don\u2019t think I can, then I guess I can\u2019t.\u201d Pushing past that is hard to do, but you can. When other people put limits on you, ignore them. So what if you fail, at least you can say you tried. Honestly, that\u2019s just kind of what I\u2019ve done, and more often than not, you succeed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Read more of Englert\u2019s story in a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gohuskies.com\/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=30200&amp;ATCLID=208025435\"><span class=\"s2\">2012 interview<\/span><\/a> with UW Athletics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Profile: Eleni Englert<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n\t<li class=\"li10\"><span class=\"s1\">Year: Senior<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li class=\"li10\"><span class=\"s1\">Hometown: Vista, Calif.<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li class=\"li10\"><span class=\"s1\">Major: Business Administration- Information Systems<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Know your rowing lingo<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n\t<li class=\"li10\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Freshman\/Varsity eight<\/b>: A boat with eight rowers, led by one coxswain<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li class=\"li10\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Coxswain<\/b>: Team member who sits in the stern, facing the bow, and is responsible for steering the boat and coordinating the power and rhythm of the rowers<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li class=\"li10\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Shell<\/b>: Boats used for crew races<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li class=\"li10\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Erg (or \u201cErgometer\u201d)<\/b>: An indoor rowing machine<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li class=\"li10\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Oar: <\/b>Used to drive the boat forward; don\u2019t call them paddles<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>"},{"title":"Alumni communities foster UW spirit worldwide","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/alumni-communities-foster-uw-spirit-worldwide\/","tags":["alumni","arts-sciences","foster-school-of-business","global","school-of-law"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Global Husky networks build and grow UW community abroad.","content":"(UWAA, March 2016)\n\nIn 2014, <strong>Morgan Thompson<\/strong>, \u201802, and his wife moved from New York to Zurich, Switzerland. After settling in, he decided to seek out other UW alumni living in Zurich. His wife, an Indiana University alumna, had connected with a small but lively Hoosier community in Switzerland, and Thompson hoped to find a similar network of Huskies.\n\nAfter reaching out to the UW and researching on LinkedIn, Thompson discovered that while there were approximately 100 UW alumni in Switzerland, they\u2019d never come together as Huskies. So he organized the first-ever Switzerland Huskies meet-up. The inaugural event, dinner at a local restaurant, took place in January 2016 and attracted a small but diverse group of Switzerland-based alumni. Few of them knew each other prior to getting together, but they enjoyed the opportunity to meet and share memories of the UW. They\u2019re now planning a year\u2019s worth of events they can do as an alumni group: Swiss chocolate and wine tastings, outings to hockey games and a possible summer alumni barbecue. They even hope to host an Apple Cup event in the fall, provided they can figure out how to work around the nine-hour time difference.\n\nThis newly-formed Switzerland Husky community is one of 10 alumni networks outside the United States. Like U.S.-based communities, global chapters have sprouted in areas where there are UW alumni interested in and excited about staying connected to the UW. These chapters reflect where Huskies come from before entering the UW as students and where they relocate after receiving their degrees. From small, emerging clusters in places such as Zurich and London, to formally organized chapters as in Beijing and Bangkok, global Husky communities are motivated by building and growing UW community: linking alumni abroad to each other and to the UW.\n\n<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>\n\n<strong>Building community<\/strong>\n\n<strong>Hyun Kim<\/strong>, \u201985, \u201990, is president of the UWAA Korea chapter. Established in the early 1970s, it is one of the largest and oldest international chapters. There are more than 1,000 UW alumni in Korea, and Kim says that while many of them have wonderful memories of and strong feelings toward their alma mater, they don\u2019t always know how to connect with the UW from so far away.\n\nKim sees UWAA Korea as a key link to bolstering this bond. \u201cIf we can have a strong Husky community in Korea, we can better support our alumni and, in turn, give back to the UW more effectively,\u201d he says.\n\nIn addition to providing a support framework for UW alumni abroad, many international alumni chapters also work to develop close ties with current and prospective students and their parents. <strong>Su Cheng Harris-Simpson<\/strong>, \u201989, serves as president of the UWAA Beijing chapter. She has lived in Beijing for nearly 20 years and has observed the chapter transform largely due to a diversifying student body. Early on, she says, the Beijing Husky community functioned as a way for expatriate alumni to meet each other and stay apprised with what was happening in Washington and at the UW.\n\n<strong>\n<\/strong>However, as more Chinese students attend college in the U.S., she has noticed her chapter\u2019s community expanding. \u201cFor students currently studying at the UW who will return to China after graduation, this community will be their base,\u201d she says. Harris-Simpson believes that UWAA Beijing will provide a space for graduates to continue their Husky experience and share it with others. \u201cThey will be the future leaders of UWAA Beijing, and we current leaders see great value in helping our young alumni grow into leadership roles,\u201d she explains.\n\n<strong>Growing a global Husky family<\/strong>\n\nLike UWAA Beijing, several international alumni communities understand their \u201cHusky family\u201d as much more than just alumni. Chapters, such as UWAA Japan and UWAA Singapore, work with UW registered student organizations to host annual summer student send-off events, where incoming UW students and their families can meet current students and parents, in addition to alums.\n\nKim says that UWAA Korea is eager to be a resource for recent graduates. His chapter follows a formal leadership structure, in which senior alumni hold administrative offices. Young alumni are encouraged to serve in secretarial roles, where they work closely with and learn from the higher ranking leaders. This gives younger alums the space to cultivate leadership skills, and older alums an opportunity to mentor younger generations, Kim explains.\n\nIn addition to building community in their countries, many chapter leaders are actively working to develop relationships with other global chapters. In November 2015, 25 leaders from eight international chapters came together in Shanghai to participate in the first global UW alumni leadership conference.\nDuring the conference, leaders shared their best leadership practices and their chapters\u2019 alumni engagement success stories. They also discussed their goals for future growth and activities as well as their collective interest in helping the UW strengthen its brand internationally by creating the most welcoming and inclusive global network of UW advocates.UW President Ana Mari Cauce attended the event and presented the chapter presidents in attendance with appreciation awards to thank them for their outstanding leadership. Recipients included <strong>Sean Liu<\/strong>, \u201987 (Shanghai), <strong>Su Cheng Harris-Simpson<\/strong>, \u201989 (Beijing), <strong>Lui Tong<\/strong>, \u201990 (Hong Kong), <strong>Somboon Chaya,<\/strong>\u201978 (Thailand), <strong>David Satterwhite<\/strong>, \u201979, \u201994 (Japan) and\u00a0<strong>Elaine Cheo<\/strong>, \u201980, \u201982 (Singapore).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Being a World of Good<\/strong>\n\nThe UW is one of the best universities in the world, ranked \u201cmost innovative\u201d by Reuters and No. 11 globally by U.S. News &amp; World Report. Its relationship to the rest of the world has never been stronger than it is today. Much of that is owed to the global alumni communities who have helped lay the groundwork and continue to support it through engagement, community-building, volunteerism and financial contributions.\n\n\u201cA Husky network is important anywhere,\u201d say Thompson. \u201cWhile we Switzerland Huskies might have been at the UW at different times and studied different subjects, we have the common thread of UW and all of those shared experiences that go with being a Husky to unite us.\u201d\n\nSuch ties often result in lifelong relationships. The most rewarding part of Harris-Simpson\u2019s experience with UWAA Beijing has been the continual opportunities to connect with old friends and meet new ones through the chapter\u2019s growing network. And UWAA Korea leaders work hard to celebrate their members\u2019 achievements by honoring outstanding alumni and commemorating significant milestones in members\u2019 lives. \u201cWhen there is a wedding for our members, our chapter leaders will send a congratulatory note, and when there is a funeral, we will attend or send our official flag to express our condolence,\u201d says Kim.\n\nAt the core of all global Husky alumni groups is a commitment to community. \u201cIt\u2019s been a rewarding challenge to organize people to come together with the purpose of creating goodwill for the UW and its alumni,\u201d says UWAA Thailand chapter president Somboon Chaya. \u201cThrough our\u00a0chapter activities, we seek to demonstrate happiness, and for us, happiness is being part of the Husky family,\u201d he says.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/alumni\/communities\/international-huskies\/\">Learn more about global Husky communities<\/a>.\n\n&nbsp;"},{"title":"Deep brain stimulation helps UW prof live with Parkinson's","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/deep-brain-stimulation-helps-uw-prof-live-with-parkinsons\/","tags":["faculty","public-health","medicine"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"Getting up from a chair once posed a challenge. Now Steven Gilbert walks more than five miles a day.","content":"(Health Sciences NewsBeat, March 2016)\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On July 11, 2015, eight people crowded into a clinic room at UW Medical Center,\u00a0expectantly\u00a0watching <a href=\"http:\/\/deohs.washington.edu\/faculty\/gilbert_steven\"><span class=\"s2\">Steven Gilbert<\/span><\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">They included his neurologist, neurophysiologist, and his partner of more than two decades. All recognized the debilitating effects of Parkinson\u2019s disease but no one more than Gilbert, who had lived with it for nearly 15 years and who, as a neurotoxicologist, deeply understood the disease\u2019s destruction. He had founded and directed the Institute of Neurotoxicology and Neurological Disorders.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sitting in clinic, Gilbert appeared no different than he had before brain surgery. His arms rhythmically fluttered from an involuntary tremor. His right leg twitched.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">More than a month had passed since UW Medicine neurosurgeon <a href=\"http:\/\/www.uwmedicine.org\/bios\/andrew-ko\"><span class=\"s2\">Andrew Ko<\/span><\/a> had surgically placed electrodes in a vital region of Gilbert\u2019s brain, woven wires down through his neck, and clipped the leads to a battery pack implanted under the skin on his chest.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Now the neurophysiologist was about to turn on the system.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What Parkinson\u2019s involves<\/b>\nAbout 60,000 Americans are diagnosed with Parkinson's disease each year. What causes the disease is unclear. Researchers have investigated exposures to pesticides, manganese and other potential environmental triggers. Less common are cases that can be linked to genetic mutations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the disease, the dopamine-producing cells die off in a region of the brain called the substantia nigra. Symptoms \u2013 twitching of limbs, slowness of movement, stiffness, impaired balance \u2013 grow worse with time. \u00a0Eventually the disease leads to speech problems and sometimes dementia. A dual drug regimen of carbidopa and levodopa is typically prescribed; they supply dopamine to the brain and other parts of the body, but come with side effects, too.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gilbert,\u00a0a University of Washington associate professor of environmental and occupational health sciences,\u00a0opted against medication. Instead, he said, his \u201cdrug of choice\u201d was exercise, particularly cycling.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>\u2018Leave no neurotoxicologist behind!\u2019<\/b>\nHis wife, Janice Camp, described him as a one-time elite cyclist. He biked RAMROD, a 149-mile loop of Mount Rainier with 10,000 feet of ascent. He regularly cycled 30 or 40 miles with a peloton in and around Seattle. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gilbert was 50 when he noticed a slight tremor in his right foot. Five or six years went by with little change. Then the involuntary twitch grew more noticeable, and then a tremor developed in his hand, and then his arm. His right leg weakened such that he couldn\u2019t keep pace with the other cyclists climbing hills, but the group came up with an encouraging shout, \u201cLeave no neurotoxicologist behind!\u201d and one of them would double back and ride with Gilbert until they caught up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Three years ago he switched to biking tandem with another rider, and then a year ago, even that became impossible. Walking uphill and rising from a chair were struggles. He couldn\u2019t maneuver through tight or crowded spaces like a mall or airport; independent travel, essential to his career as a lecturer and consultant, stopped.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>A candidate for brain stimulation<\/b>\nGilbert met with Ko, a UW assistant professor of neurological surgery, who performs deep brain stimulation (DBS) on patients with advanced Parkinson\u2019s. DBS interrupts abnormal neuronal activity in the brain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">DBS doesn\u2019t help patients\u2019 problems with balance, sleeping or speech, nor does it slow the progression of the neurodegenerative disease. Only about 10 to 20 percent of people with Parkinson\u2019s are eligible for the procedure.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">During the first surgery on June 4, 2015, Ko used MRI and CT images to guide two electrodes into Gilbert\u2019s brain, beside the subthalamic nucleus. It\u2019s an area a few millimeters wide and adjacent to structures critical to movement. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A month later, Gilbert was surrounded by eight people in a clinic room when the neurophysiologist, Vicente Martinez, fired up the system. Ali Samii, Gilbert's neurologist of 10 years, looked on. With the first electrode, nothing happened.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With the second electrode, Gilbert\u2019s tremors stopped, and soon after that he stood with little effort and walked out of the room and down the hall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt was pretty surreal to me, beyond belief,\u201d Janice Camp said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Life-changing after-effects<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Now Gilbert walks six to seven miles a day. He picks up his granddaughters at the end of the day, one from elementary school and the other from daycare.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He rides tandem with a friend, using a customized bicycle trainer. He recently accepted a prestigious communication award at from the Society of Toxicology at an awards ceremony in New Orleans and visited his family in upstate New York.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cDeep brain stimulation changed my life,\u201d Gilbert said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">His left leg still has a slight tremor, as does his right arm when he lifts it.

Even though going to college and traveling the world was a goal of mine, it seemed impossible.\u201d But thanks to scholarship support, Bell \u2014 who will graduate in June with a dual degree in social welfare and business \u2014 was able to not only attend the UW, but cross two continents off his list.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">First up was a trip to Brazil through the business school, which inspired him to return again \u2014 this time, to get more invested in the culture and the people by teaching English, learning Portuguese along the way. He was hooked. \u201cI was able to make it happen once, and then say \u2018You know what? I\u2019m going to do it again,\u2019\u201d says Bell, who received support from a <a href=\"http:\/\/foster.uw.edu\/centers\/gbc\/resources\/scholarships\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Global Business Center scholarship<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">My time at the UW has taught me to take advantage of every opportunity and to never discount yourself or get discouraged. Now, I\u2019m always putting my name in the hat and believing in myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">So he did, jumping on a four-month student exchange program in Mannheim, Germany through the <a href=\"http:\/\/foster.uw.edu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Foster School of Business<\/span><\/a>, where he balanced masters-level courses with travels across Europe. \u201cBeing able to see \u2014 and touch \u2014\u00a0the Berlin Wall and ancient castles, and all the old, gothic architecture was really cool,\u201d says Bell. \u201cIt was surreal to see the Olympic stadium, too. I\u2019d seen it in documentaries about Jesse Owens, and I always hoped one day I\u2019d be able to go there. To actually do that was incredible.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">But more rewarding than being able to witness European history firsthand, says Bell, were the connections he made throughout his journey \u2014 and the ways those connections helped him think about his own identity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI met people from France, Germany, Spain, Columbia, Kuwait, Egypt \u2014 all over the world,\u201d he says. \u201cI would sit down and talk to them about their cultures and where they\u2019re from, and it was really cool to be able to share my experiences as an African American male and educate people about my background while learning about theirs and breaking down stereotypes. It helped me think about my identity and how important it is for me to continue traveling and sharing.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Now, Bell \u2014 who\u2019s been a leader and mentor on campus through the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/omad\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Office of Minority Affairs &amp; Diversity<\/span><\/a>, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.asuw.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Associated Students of the University of Washington<\/span><\/a>, and the <a href=\"http:\/\/foster.uw.edu\/academics\/degree-programs\/undergraduate-programs\/diversity-services\/young-executives-of-color-yeoc\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Young Executives of Color<\/span><\/a> \u2014 has made it his mission to help other people from similar backgrounds realize their goals, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cBeing able to travel abroad has inspired me and shown me that anything is possible. I love encouraging others, and I want to help other people realize their dreams can come true, too,\u201d says Bell. \u201cSharing my experiences and saying, \u2018This is where I was, and I see a lot of potential in <i>you<\/i>,\u2019 and helping those students who were in my same shoes reach their goals has been really rewarding,\u201d says Bell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Next up? Graduate school, to earn his masters in social work with a focus in business and combine the two worlds to do community development on an international level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cMy time at the UW has taught me to take advantage of every opportunity and to never discount yourself or get discouraged,\u201d says Bell. \u201cNow, I\u2019m always putting my name in the hat and believing in myself.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h3 class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Support study abroad<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">The Global Business Center scholarship helps undergraduate and graduate students in the Foster School of Business participate in exchange or study abroad programs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/giving\/make-a-gift\/?page=make&amp;code=MITSUI\">Give to the scholarship fund<\/a><\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"Faculty Friday: Dee Boersma","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/faculty-friday-dee-boersma\/","tags":["arts-sciences","faculty","global"],"pillars":["innovation","student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In Dee Boersma's Science Communication: Video Storytelling class, students fuse cinema and science to produce educational films about the natural sciences.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n&nbsp;","content":"<p class=\"p1\">(The Whole U, April 2016)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Doomsday stories are easy to find at the box office these days. Biology professor Dee Boersma wants to see more movies about saving the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In her class Science Communication: Video Storytelling, students produce educational films about the natural sciences. Viewers get tours of the coral reefs of Hawaii and the forests of Washington, and explore topics like endangered animals, food waste, and water pollution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Boersma has fused cinema and science since 2010, thanks to a Fulbright Scholarship to study filmmaking at the University of Otago in New Zealand. The scholarship trained\u00a0her to document her own research out in the field, but it\u2019s also allowed\u00a0her to reach creative young minds back at the UW.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cMy sense was, there are Steven Spielbergs out there that I\u2019ll never be able to reach, because I don\u2019t teach in a film school,\u201d Boersma said. \u201cAnd yet, those sorts of people can reach a broader audience than I could ever reach for conservation.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The course is co-taught with documentary filmmaker Jo Ardinger. Students upload their videos on the YouTube channel <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCEmBQCvT2HX8YKJGWFl4c_Q\/feed\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>UW Student Science Videos<\/b><\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The films must be based on good science, but they also need to engage a general viewer. Some of the projects explain the science behind everyday life: the chemistry of coffee, the physics of kicking a soccer ball, and colorblindness in dogs (which, by the way, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GrDmhIpRCOQ\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>is a myth<\/b><\/span><\/a>).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For the students, the projects are a way to reach people in a world of short attention spans. And for Boersma, filmmaking is a way to reach students who grew up in that world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cPeople don\u2019t like reading as much as they used to, and they definitely aren\u2019t interested in writing papers,\u201d Boersma said. \u201cBut they are still interested in communicating.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The students make four video projects over three months. The first is a public service announcement for World Penguin Day, which is April 25. Students edit films out of footage shot by Boersma, a penguin expert, during her travels to the Gal\u00e1pagos, Africa and Argentina.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Boersma, who came to the UW in 1974, is the director of the UW Center for Penguins as Ocean Sentinels. A \u201csentinel,\u201d she\u00a0explained, is something that alerts you to changes in the environment; paying attention to penguins can show us what\u2019s going on in the natural world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIf there\u2019s not a good quality of life for a penguin, it\u2019s probably not going to be a good quality of life for us, either,\u201d Boersma said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">By examining penguins over time, scientists can see the toll that climate change is having on the world, similar to observing glaciers. The difference is that penguins are cute and charismatic. \u201cPeople are not nearly as engaged with glaciers as they are with penguins,\u201d Boersma said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a doctoral student at Ohio State University, Boersma did her dissertation on penguins in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, the only place in the northern hemisphere that you can find penguins \u2014 with the exception of zoos.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cZoos can provide you with an experience with penguins. They\u2019re acting as an ambassador to their species,\u201d Boersma said. \u201cBut what we really need is for you to help protect them in the wild.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Boersma has a B.S. from Central Michigan University and a Ph.D. from Ohio State University.

Workers unable to pay for basic groceries convinced her of the \u201ceconomic catastrophe\u201d of low-paying jobs at the airport.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For Mohamed Ileye, imam of the Al Noor Mosque near the airport, the defining moment was a \u201cpray-in\u201d rally by Teamsters union members at the rental agency Hertz. The union joined East-African immigrants in demanding the right to pray during the work day at Hertz, which had fired 25 Muslim workers over the issue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For Don Liberty, owner of nearby Bull Pen Pub Bar &amp; Grill, the reasoning was simple: Better-paid workers would have more money to spend at his business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This alliance\u2014unions, religious groups, immigrant and community groups, and some local businesses\u2014 led to two of the most important workers\u2019 rights victories in recent history. In 2013, the city of SeaTac passed a voter referendum raising the minimum wage to $15, the highest in the nation. The measure passed by a mere 77 votes. Six months later the city of Seattle reached its own agreement to raise its minimum wage to $15, phased in over several years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Now a groundbreaking digital project at the University of Washington is preserving the knowledge of the SeaTac and Seattle victories, ensuring that scholars, activists, journalists, and others can learn from the hard-fought campaigns. The <a href=\"http:\/\/content.lib.washington.edu\/projects\/sea15\/index.html\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>SeaTac-Seattle Minimum Wage Campaign History Project <\/b><\/span><\/a>offers a repository of oral history interviews (videos, audio, and transcripts) with key players, along with rally signs, campaign website captures, media coverage, analytical essays, and a timeline of wage increases nationwide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The archive tracks the experiences of both leaders and airport workers who volunteered to knock on doors. The campaign group Working Washington registered nearly 1,000 new SeaTac voters in the working-class city of 27,000, which turned out to be crucial in the narrow victory. Many of those volunteers were immigrants new to the democratic process, said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.polisci.washington.edu\/people\/michael-w-mccann\"><span class=\"s2\">Michael W. McCann<\/span><\/a>, UW Professor of Political Science, Director of the Harry Bridges Center for Labor Studies, and co-director of the archive project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cMany of the workers spoke about how the law changes their lives because they will have more money,\u201d McCann said. \u201cBut they also spoke about how it gave them an incredible sense of agency. They changed the world in which they are a part. They participated in democracy in action.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Capturing History in Real-Time<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Religious leaders and workers gather at Sea-Tac International Airport, courtesy reclaimtheamericandream.org.<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">The archive launched in January 2016 and will continue growing over time. It\u2019s hosted by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lib.washington.edu\/specialcollections\/laws\/\"><span class=\"s3\">Labor Archives of Washington<\/span><\/a>, part of UW Libraries, which is developing digital-preservation practices to ensure the archive outlives changing technology and file formats, a persistent problem for digital scholarship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The project is inspired by a model of public history websites developed by UW Professor of History <a href=\"http:\/\/faculty.washington.edu\/gregoryj\/\"><span class=\"s2\">James Gregory<\/span><\/a> on the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/civilr\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project<\/span><\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/labhist\/\"><span class=\"s2\">subsequent websites<\/span><\/a>. Those projects present history in visual, interactive ways that can attract broader audiences than traditional scholarly books.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt is going to be an extraordinarily rich historical record,\u201d said Gregory, an advisor on the project. \u201cPreserving the history of social movements is always important, but doubly so in the case of the minimum wage campaign because so many other communities are considering similar efforts.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Michael McCann<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">McCann and project co-director<a href=\"http:\/\/guides.lib.uw.edu\/c.php?g=341780&amp;p=2299770\"><span class=\"s3\">Conor M. Casey<\/span><\/a>, Labor Archivist at Labor Archives of Washingon, built a team of undergraduate and graduate students trained in labor studies and preservation methods. They interviewed more than fifty people, including airport workers, neighbors, union leaders, politicians, journalists, religious leaders like Bolerjack and Ileye, and business owners, including both supporters and opponents of minimum wage reform. They also collected picket signs, sashes, banners, buttons, and other physical artifacts that illustrate how the diverse coalition found a sense of shared purpose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThere\u2019s a very rich symbolic artistic and cultural tradition in the labor movement that signifies and builds community,\u201d said Casey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The team heard from supporters compelled by moral arguments: Those who work shouldn\u2019t live in poverty. They also heard pragmatic arguments that better wages are good for capitalism, because a stable working class has more money to spend. Nick Hanauer, the billionaire Seattle investor, said as much in a widely-read <a href=\"http:\/\/www.politico.com\/magazine\/story\/2014\/06\/the-pitchforks-are-coming-for-us-plutocrats-108014\"><span class=\"s2\">Politico Magazine essay<\/span><\/a>, \u201cThe Pitchforks Are Coming\u2026 For Us Plutocrats,\u201d and in an interview with the research team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Mobilizing Against Inequality<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Demonstrators outside Seattle City Hall, courtesy Working Washington Records, Labor Archives of Washington, UW Libraries Special Collections<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">In 2013, in the shadow of the Great Recession, when \u201causterity\u201d figured more heavily in national politics than workers\u2019 rights, the victories were instrumental in driving national conversations toward the growing inequality gap. Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, and other cities followed suit with their own minimum wage increases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The wage increases came with a suite of complementary policies, some of them just as important to low-wage workers. Those include paid sick time, more consistent scheduling, protections against wage theft, requirements to offer full-time work before hiring more part-time workers, and successorship clauses to protect workers when vendor contracts change hands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Conor Casey<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Many SeaTac workers, however, have yet to see the benefits they won. Alaska Airlines has led an appeal arguing the law should not apply to the airport itself, which is managed by the Port of Seattle. The\u00a0Washington state Supreme Court ruled in favor of workers in August 2015, but Alaska Airlines has appealed that decision and withheld wage increases. If workers prevail, they will receive significant back pay dating back to 2014, but that\u2019s a painful delay for those living near the poverty line. (The law is also restricted to businesses of ten or more employees.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In Seattle, a decision came more quickly, propelled by the endorsements of mayoral candidate Ed Murray and City Council candidate Kshama Sawant. When they both won in November 2013, Murray assembled a commission of worker\u2019s advocates, business leaders, and others, and told them to find a compromise. Several months later the group reached a plan, which the City Council passed unanimously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The city\u2019s new Office of Labor Standards, which helps enforce policies regarding paid sick leave, tipping, and related issues, is one more innovation other cities can learn from, says Riddhi Mehta-Neugebauer, a UW political science doctoral student on the archives team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The Future of Labor Unions<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Of all the questions the new archives can help address, one looms largest for McCann: How can labor unions reclaim influence in a globalized economy? The SeaTac referendum came about precisely because of the shrinking power of unions in the airline industry. In 2005, Alaska Airlines fired nearly five hundred union baggage handlers and replaced them with workers employed by contractors. Where the union workers made approximately $13 an hour, the new employees began at less than $10.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A local Service Employees International Union (SEIU) chapter provided most of the funding for the SeaTac campaign, but it was the coalition-building that proved decisive, McCann said. After the Teamsters rally at Hertz, Ileye, the imam, <a href=\"http:\/\/reclaimtheamericandream.org\/success-wages\/\"><span class=\"s2\">told<\/span><\/a> the website Reclaiming the American Dream, \u201cThat is the reason why we came out in support of the union. Because we saw that for the union, this is not only a money issue. The unions support and respect the values and social rights of the people.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">McCann, who has studied organized labor since he worked in high school to desegregate all-white building trades in Florida, believes unions can be strongest when they fight for the well-being of all workers, including minorities and new immigrants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIn the greatest moments for labor during the twentieth century, unions had primarily seen themselves as agents for the entire working class, not just their own members,\u201d he said. \u201cThey fought for Social Security and other policies that helped everyone. That declined somewhat after World War II, and I think what\u2019s happening with the minimum-wage campaigns is a resurgence of that commitment to improving the lives of all workers.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">-----<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/content.lib.washington.edu\/projects\/sea15\/index.html\"><i>Explore the SeaTac-Seattle Minimum Wage Campaign History Project<\/i><\/a><\/span><span class=\"s4\"><i>.<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>The SeaTac-Seattle Minimum Wage Campaign History Project is supported by the Simpson Center for the Humanities and the Harry Bridges Center for Labor Studies.<\/i><\/span><\/p>"},{"title":"The Instagram militia and the limits of empathy","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/the-instagram-militia-and-the-limits-of-empathy\/","tags":["arts-sciences","faculty","giving"],"pillars":["innovation"],"image":"","excerpt":"Tad Hirsch, assistant professor of interaction design, stitches together 80,000 assault-rifle selfies to examine America\u2019s gun divide.","content":"(Simpson Center for the Humanities, March 2016)\n\nThe people holding assault rifles in Tad Hirsch\u2019s recent artwork display them in a staggering array of poses. They aim their weapons in shooting ranges, hunting grounds, and bedrooms. They wear camouflage and gold chains and night-vision goggles. They strike poses from <em>Grand Theft Auto <\/em>and <em>Call of Duty<\/em>. They glower and smirk and stare deadpan at the camera. They flex biceps and show cleavage. They display guns beside four-wheelers, beside dogs, and, in a startling number, beside babies.\n\nThe common element is the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, the most popular rifle in the United States.\n\nHirsch, Assistant Professor of Interaction Design at the University of Washington, wrote a script to pull every image tagged with \u201c#AR15\u201d on Instagram over eight months in 2013. That yielded 79,898 posts. He used face-recognition software and narrowed the set down to 15,000, which he arranged in a digital mosaic titled \u201cA Well-Regulated Militia,\u201d first displayed at the UW\u2019s <a title=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/art.washington.edu\/about\/artfacilities\/galleries\/jake\/\">Jacob Lawrence Gallery<\/a>\u00a0in fall 2015. Viewers navigate the screen with a fish-eye distortion lens, mousing across to make images rise and recede in a sea of selfies.\n\nThe effect is potent. I went to see Hirsch\u2019s exhibit hoping for a moment of empathetic connection. I expected to find that gun selfies are just one more flavor of social-media performance. Whether we pose to show off our guns or clothes or kids or latte art or whatever, we\u2019re all trying to say <em>Look at me, I\u2019m having fun, I\u2019m strong, funny, beautiful, lovable<\/em>, and on.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what I found. Hirsch\u2019s installation made clear that semi-automatic rifles are not neutral objects but \u201ccontentious products,\u201d in his words. They are instruments of death. The AR-15 was used in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting, the 2015 San Bernardino Shooting, and many other mass shootings. That fact shapes how I view the photos\u2014how many people view the AR-15. The faces in Hirsch\u2019s mosaic carry an undercurrent of aggression or belligerence or raging against the President. Others exude simple glee at doing something transgressive\u2014something that will piss off liberals. Finding empathy was more difficult than I expected.\n\nThat difficulty is what first drew Hirsch to examine the \u201cInstagram militia,\u201d as AR-15 owners on the app are known. After the Sandy Hook shooting and the subsequent failure of Congress to pass even modest gun-control legislation, he felt the public debate was missing something about the everyday lived experience of gun owners.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be a very particular way of talking about guns, on the part of both gun advocates and gun-control advocates,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like a very narrow discussion. Not knowing anything about guns or the people who love them, I just intuitively felt like that conversation wasn\u2019t capturing part of the experience of guns for people who find them meaningful.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, his son, then five, was growing fascinated with guns. \u201cI was trying to understand what he sees in them,\u201d Hirsch said. \u201cIn some ways I get it. I was like that at eight years old, but in other ways I was really struggling.\u201d\n<h2>America\u2019s Gun<\/h2>\nThe mosaic is part of Hirsch\u2019s broader study of US gun culture, a project that straddles art, design, and scholarly analysis. He draws on his previous work as a programmer\u2014before coming to the UW he was a research scientist at Intel Labs and Motorola\u2019s Advanced Concepts Group. He manipulates the Instagram dataset on multiple levels, sorting images and their captions, comments, and location information in search of patterns. His project, supported by a <a title=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/simpsoncenter.org\/programs\/fellowships\/summer-digital-humanities-2015\">Digital Humanities Summer Fellowship<\/a> from the Simpson Center for the Humanities in 2015, is titled \u201cField-Stripping America\u2019s Rifle.\u201d Just as a soldier or hunter dissembles a complex weapon to examine its components, Hirsch wants to peel back the layers of performance involved in gun selfies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really interested in the question of how to do public engagement around the gun question,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do you do it in a way that\u2019s not just about disseminating information, but in a way that creates some kind of encounter with the artifacts of culture?\u201d\n\nHis gun research quickly brought him to the AR-15, the civilian version of the military M-16, nicknamed \u201cAmerica\u2019s gun.\u201d There are millions in circulation in the US. \u201cIt\u2019s the one that makes gun-control advocates craziest,\u201d Hirsch said. \u201cIt\u2019s the hardest one to justify.\u201d\n\nBecause Craigslist bans gun sales, Instagram has become a de facto gun market, largely unregulated (its parent company, Facebook, has<a title=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/01\/30\/technology\/facebook-gun-sales-ban.html?smid=tw-share\">taken some steps<\/a> to restrict gun sales). The site includes thousands of images of AR-15 ammunition clips, scopes, grips, night vision devices, laser-targeting devices, sound suppressors, and other accessories. The AR-15\u2019s modular design, with a core platform to which users attach components, makes the possibilities for accessorizing essentially endless. The gun has been called \u201cLegos for grown-ups\u201d and a \u201cBarbie doll for guys.\u201d\n\nAs Hirsch sorted his images by color, he found clusters of bright pink accessories, suggesting a gendered dimension to AR-15 culture. Another cluster gathered the <a title=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.vox.com\/2015\/7\/26\/9036993\/meme-font-impact\">blocky white text<\/a> of social-media memes. Camouflage clothing clustered together, as did black Mafioso suits. Hirsch grew interested in the different tropes that Instagram users emulate in their clothing and posture\u2014militarized \u201cblack ops\u201d poses, gangsta-rap poses, white-collar <em>Grand Theft Auto<\/em>poses, and paintball and airsoft poses.\n\nAs he worked with other digital humanities faculty at the Simpson Center, Hirsch discovered parallels to the rise of \u201cdistant reading\u201d that literary scholars use to analyze large bodies of text. Like algorithmic textual analysis, Hirsch\u2019s visual analysis is an experiment in method for the scholar. It also opens up new paths of exploration for viewers, who do their own navigation.\n\n\u201cInstead of closing down the possibilities for inquiry, Tad has developed interfaces that facilitate the viewer's interpretive engagement with the data,\u201d said Luke Bergmann (Geography), another fellow in the 2015 digital humanities <a title=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/simpsoncenter.org\/programs\/fellowships\/summer-digital-humanities-2015\">program<\/a>.\n<h2>Sales Pitches<\/h2>\nIn a preliminary finding, Hirsch said there seems to be a strong correlation between posts invoking Second-Amendment language of liberty and images promoting gun commerce. In other words, such language may be less about values than a sales pitch. But Hirsch is less interested in pushing conclusions than in creating space for viewers to do their own interpretation.\n\n\u201cI want to create situations where people can do their own interpretive work,\u201d he said. \u201cRather than me telling you what an artifact means, you decide what you think it means. That\u2019s where I want the gallery shows to go.\u201d\n\nHe has further exhibits along with publishing projects in the works. In \u201c<a title=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/141140491\">Seattle City Bang-Bang<\/a>,\u201d a companion piece at the Jacob Lawrence Gallery last fall, a small box was mounted on a wall. Each time a gunshot was recorded in Seattle police logs, a loud audible shot rang out in the gallery. The box also emitted a paper ticker, like a receipt printer, with the shot\u2019s date, time, and location. Within a few weeks a 15-foot paper trail crept across the floor, forcing visitors to step around it. Where crime maps make it easy to imagine gun violence as an isolated problem in \u201cproblem neighborhoods,\u201d the ticker and audible shots suggest they are everyone\u2019s problem, Hirsch said. The ticker's bureaucratic tone also suggests the role of public policy in creating concentrated violence.\n\nScott Lawrimore, director of the gallery, watched visitors react to both pieces. As the images flew by on a projection screen, viewers shook their heads in shock or laughed, another way of dealing with disturbing material.\n\n\u201cThe piece is troubling,\u201d he said. \u201cTo see how proud people are of those guns . . . That gun is designed to do one thing, which is kill people, and kill a lot of them. It represents some of the worst aspects of our humanity.\u201d\n<h2>Empathy and Selfies<\/h2>\nAs I navigated the screen, it was hard to avoid the conclusion that AR-15s represent a form of power to a class of Americans who feel passed by in a multicultural-globalized-gilded-wealth world. They \u201ccling to guns or religion,\u201d in Barack Obama\u2019s infamous\u00a0<a title=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2008\/apr\/14\/barackobama.uselections2008\">formulation<\/a>from a private fundraiser in 2008.\n\nBut that\u2019s a condescending interpretation, and I don\u2019t trust condescending answers to capture the whole truth. This dilemma brought to mind Lewis Nordan\u2019s novel about the intoxicating power that Mississippi Delta boys find in guns,<em> The Sharpshooter Blues<\/em>(1995). Nordan\u2019s characters are rural youngsters, suspicious of scolding from wealthy outsiders and delighted at the explosive potential of guns. Unlike Hirsch\u2019s defiant faces, Nordan\u2019s characters become likeable three-dimensional people through the course of the book, with particular quirks, blind spots, and virtues. That makes all the difference.\n\nHirsch\u2019s mosaic reveals, I think, the limited ability of social media to promote empathy. Great stories, like great photographs and other artwork (not to mention face-to-face conversation) can create lines of connection between people who think they have none. That possibility is severely diminished in the endless procession of selfies we get on Instagram and other social media. Yet empathy is precisely what we need on these sites where so much of our public discourse has moved.\n\nHirsch\u2019s project brings viewers eye-level with faces that resist easy connection. In doing so, it demonstrates the insufficiency of, <a title=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/national\/archive\/2011\/12\/a-muscular-empathy\/249984\/\">in writer Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019 words<\/a>, \u201ca soft, flattering, hand-holding empathy,\u201d the sort meant to make us feel better without any honest reckoning of our most difficult divisions. It nudges us toward what Coates calls \u201ca muscular empathy,\u201d rooted in curiosity and developed through education.\n\nSuch work requires more than looking at selfies. By exposing the limitations of such images, Hirsch makes a powerful case for looking beyond them."},{"title":"By veterans, for veterans","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/by-veterans-for-veterans\/","tags":["alumni","arts-sciences","graduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"Graduate student and veteran Lindsay Zike wanted to help others make the transition from soldier to student.

It\u2019s focusing on building relationships among faculty, staff and service members looking to complete their education. And it provides a place of gathering \u2014 and connection \u2014 for student veterans.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t talk to anyone around me,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t fit in with my fellow college students.\u201dThe inspiration for the OSVL stemmed from graduate student Lindsay Zike\u2019s personal experience as an undergraduate. Having arrived on campus after serving four years in the Navy and being medically retired, she made the challenging transition from military to civilian life largely on her own.\n\nWith the future of UW student veterans in mind, Zike set out to drive the change she wanted to see. She worked alongside several student veterans to establish the place she had been looking for all along.\n\n\u201cIt feels amazing to be able to give this back to others,\u201d Zike says. \u201cIt was huge to be able to lead the team to get this here, and I\u2019ll always look back and be proud of this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe space is instrumental,\u201d says Air Force combat veteran Sam Powers, the office\u2019s first director. \u201cI\u2019ve watched some wonderful connections and relationships develop here, and it has been instrumental in helping student veterans get through their classes. It\u2019s also a safe place for student veterans, and I want to keep it that way.\u201d\n\nThe need for a safe space is indeed critical. With suicide currently the second-leading cause of death in U.S. veterans and PTSD rates close to 20 percent, the services the office will bring to campus will drastically impact the lives of veterans who return to school.\n\nThanks to the OSVL, student veterans have a space to connect with others who have similar experiences and backgrounds \u2014 helping to combat feelings of isolation and loneliness, which often can segue into deeper feelings of depression and self-harm.\n\nFuture trainings and a certification program the OSVL plans to offer will provide faculty and staff with a deeper understanding of issues and situations that may be difficult for veterans who are adjusting to student life.\n\nAnd, as the OSVL gains momentum, both Zike and Powers hope it can become a full-service office for student veterans \u2014 offering in-house mental health services, educational and financial aid resources, career counseling and interactive programming.\n\nThe team has already gotten started. They have programmed social events that build a stronger community \u2014 like Veterans Night Out, an opportunity for student veterans and their families to bond and relax in the HUB games area. Mental health and wellness programming, like yoga and art therapy, are also in the works.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been incredibly rewarding,\u201d Powers says of working at the OSVL. \u201cThese students blow me away every day.

UW faculty are helping Myanmar's citizens navigate this new reality.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, March 2016)\n\nImagine a country left behind during the digital revolution, with no internet access or smartphones. Imagine citizens dependent on word-of-mouth for information because the repressive military government monopolizes all communication. That country was Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) until 2013.\n<div class=\"fig-fix-wrap none\"><\/div>\nA reformist government speeded the transition to democracy in Myanmar three years ago, and the changes have been breathtaking \u2014 including access to information. In 2011, just four percent of the population had mobile phones. Now the figure is closer to eighty percent, with many people owning smartphones. But navigating the flood of online information can be problematic for new users with no experience assessing the trustworthiness of sites and sources. An initiative launched by UW faculty aims to change that.\n\nThe initiative, Information Strategies for Societies in Transition (ISST), is designed to build digital literacy,\u00a0information literacy, and data literacy across Myanmar. Professors Mary Callahan and Sara Curran in the Jackson School of International Studies, and Chris Coward, director of the Technology &amp; Social Change Group in the Information School, lead the project in collaboration with USAID, Microsoft, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n<div class=\"fig-fix-wrap left\"><figure class=\"image-wrap left\">\n<div id=\"file-1329\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\">\n<div class=\"content\">\u201cWhen we started this collaboration, we identified Myanmar\u2019s leap across the \u2018digital divide\u2019 as portending both enormous risks and possible opportunities in every sector,\u201d says Callahan, who has studied Myanmar for nearly 30 years. Callahan explains that the risks stem from the onslaught of relatively cheap access to unfiltered information in a country that had \u201cdiscouraged critical thinking in all ways possible\u201d for decades. The opportunities include the potential to harness the power of digital information for social good.<\/div>\n<div class=\"content\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure><\/div>\nRecognizing these risks and opportunities, the ISST team launched several projects, collaborating with local groups in Myanmar. \u201cOur feeling was that we really had to have partners in Myanmar who would lead and help drive the project,\u201d says Curran. Together they developed a curriculum around mobile information literacy, with modules covering the basics of the internet, online etiquette, privacy and security, and other topics.\n\nOne module compares Facebook and dedicated search engines as sources of information\u2014a particularly important comparison in Myanmar, where Facebook use has skyrocketed. The social network holds huge appeal to citizens who previously looked to friends and family for information when the military government controlled the media. \u201cEveryone there thinks Facebook equals the internet,\u201d says Curran. \u201cThey think Facebook is the platform in which you can find everything you need to know. We want them to understand that Facebook is a business that uses your information in a variety ways, directs you in specific ways, limits what you can see, and has algorithms in the background. It\u2019s important that people be aware of that.\u201d\n\nThe Burmese language\u00a0mobile information literacy training was first offered in Myanmar to a group of 50 mid-career professionals from government, news media, libraries, and other fields in 2014. Half of that group continued their training at a month-long workshop at the UW; upon their return to Myanmar they began leading workshops through the country\u2019s large network of libraries. The program has since\u00a0trained 300 master trainers, who have trained thousands of librarians and citizens.\n\n\u201cThere is a euphoria among all of our partners, in that almost every day they see evidence that their work is making a demonstrable difference,\u201d says Callahan. \u201cKids, the elderly, and many otherwise excluded populations are getting access not only to digital resources, but also to guidance on how to make sense of them. Our partners are not teaching people how to\u00a0surf the internet, but how <em>not<\/em> to use it in ways that could set back their personal interests and the hopes of their communities.\u201d\n<div class=\"fig-fix-wrap none\"><\/div>\nThe initiative also brings disparate groups together to pursue shared goals. At an Information Symposium held this January in Myanmar, organized by ISST, 150 Myanmar community leaders from all walks of life met to discuss next steps in the country\u2019s information revolution, including ways to leverage information technology to advance an inclusive democracy.\n\n\u201cIt was a remarkable event,\u201d says Callahan, who attended with Curran, Coward, and other UW colleagues. \u201cEverybody had something to say, from well-known writers to senior officials in the administration. There were people on opposite sides who had never actually converged before and never trusted anybody outside of their inner circle. There was a shift away from blaming the government to seeing that they, as citizens, can have a role in making things better.\u201d\n\nAs progress in Myanmar continues, UW faculty will remain involved \u2014 creating more advanced modules for mobile information literacy, and working with software company Tableau to encourage effective and transparent online content \u2014 but collaborators in Myanmar will take the lead. \u201cWe are working very closely with our partners and providing as much guidance and support as they need,\" says Curran, \"including weekly meetings, regular trips to Myanmar for hands-on support, and working groups of UW students providing research and accessible materials. But our partner organizations in Myanmar are\u00a0pretty much driving the program agenda now.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s as it should be, says Callahan, who began working in Myanmar as a graduate student in 1988.\n\n\u201cSome 27 years later, I still find the country utterly compelling in both personal and intellectual terms,\u201d\u00a0says Callahan. \u201cThere is no other place I have ever been where I have been so inspired by the resourcefulness, grit, and perseverance of people who have been dealt such an unfair hand\u00a0politically, culturally, socially, and economically. And I am so grateful to my UW colleagues, whose interests were not explicitly in Burma, but who were open enough to recognize a unique moment in history to bring our university\u2019s resources to bear upon an uncertain transition. There is still much to be accomplished in Myanmar, but it is so heartwarming to see friends who struggled to live with the most basic dignity now pursuing their long-buried visions for their country.\u201d"},{"title":"Antiquities at risk","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/antiquities-at-risk\/","tags":["arts-sciences","faculty","global","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"As ancient cultural sites\u00a0are pillaged in war-torn regions, a\u00a0new course asks\u00a0what can be done to stem the destruction.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, March 2016)\n\nLast year, ISIS members smashed ancient sculptures at the Mosul Museum in Iraq \u2014 and proudly captured the destruction on video. In Syria, archaeological sites are being looted on a regular basis. Across the Middle East, bulldozers have destroyed sites dating back thousands of years. Why is this happening? And what can be done to stop it?\n<div class=\"fig-fix-wrap none\"><\/div>\nArchaeologist Stephanie Selover, a UW assistant professor of Near Eastern languages and civilization, tackles these and other questions in a new undergraduate course, NEAR E 312: Looting and Loss: The Recent Destruction of Cultural Heritage Sites in the Middle East. The course covers the \u201cwhy\u201d of looting and seeks strategies for addressing the problem.\n\nCultural looting has surged in recent years, but the phenomenon is nothing new. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening today is monstrous, but it\u2019s not unique.\u00a0 Humans have done this over and over again,\u201d explains Selover, who devotes several class sessions to ancient Mesopotamia and the Roman Empire to make her point. \u201cWhen the Romans came to Carthage, they killed an entire civilization in the course of three years. What\u2019s different now is that we can see the destruction as it is happening, which makes it really visceral.\u201d\n\nHaving worked on excavations in Syria, Selover finds recent acts of vandalism there particularly distressing. \u201cAll of us archaeologists who have worked there watch what\u2019s happening in absolute horror,\u201d she says. \u201cSeeing everything destroyed has been heartbreaking. It\u2019s real for me. It\u2019s not just academic.\u201d\n<div class=\"fig-fix-wrap left\"><\/div>\nSelover devotes a full class session to what\u2019s happening in Syria, but she gives equal time to Iraq and Egypt because \u201cwhat these countries stand for, what their archaeology means to them, and how they see their history and their museums is different for each.\u201d The common ingredient? Political upheaval, which is usually a precursor to looting.\n\nIn Iraq, looting was nonexistent during Saddam Hussein\u2019s reign. Hussein saw modern Iraq as the true descendant of Mesopotamia and Babylon and strongly supported archaeologists\u2019 efforts to uncover and preserve that history. But when Hussein\u2019s opponents gained power, they attacked what he cared about, including archaeological sites that he\u2019d used to promote his secular concept of nationalism. Acts of ideological vandalism soon led to subsistence looting \u2014\u00a0poor individuals digging for artifacts to sell \u2014 as well as looting by organized mafias who use bulldozers to scoop up artifacts, using the profits to purchase weapons.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of reasons why people loot,\u201d says Selover. \u201cYou can\u2019t just demonize all of them. Yes, there are mafias that come in with bulldozers, but there are also poor farmers who are starving because their land has dried up and they need to feed their children. This happens everywhere when the state breaks down. People start finding ways to make money, and if you have a lot of cultural material, that\u2019s what you do.\u201d\n\nWhatever the looter\u2019s motivation, once an artifact is dug up and sold, the damage has been done. Any information the artifact might have provided is lost without a record of where it was found, objects found nearby, and other details. \u201cContext matters,\u201d says Selover. \u201cWithout that information, all that\u2019s left is a pretty pot to sell on eBay.\u201d\n\nSelover\u2019s class explores not only the problem but potential solutions. Students come at the topic from diverse backgrounds, often leading to spirited discussions about thorny ethical issues. Should the U.S. military in Baghdad have intervened when the Baghdad Museum was raided in 2003? Should subsistence looters be encouraged to record data about the artifacts they loot \u2014 essentially making them amateur archaeologists \u2014 even if they then sell the artifacts illegally? Would looting be better addressed by focusing on poverty reduction? Should artifacts not be repatriated to countries that are politically unstable?\n<div class=\"fig-fix-wrap none\"><\/div>\nDavid Stults, a senior majoring in political science and comparative religion, appreciates the opportunity to dive into difficult questions. \u201cThe class is at the very end of the day, at a terrible time, but it\u2019s the class I look forward to all week,\u201d says Stults, whose interest in the Middle East dates back to his time as a Marine serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cIn a lot of classes, professors tell you about a problem that\u2019s too late to fix. But [Professor Selover] helps us remember that what the Islamic State is doing is not the first time, and there will be others that do something similar later. So the question becomes, what can we do to fix this in the future? We bounce ideas back and forth in class and everyone comes alive.\u201d\n\nCrystal Donovan, a history major, arrived at the course with a long interest in heritage preservation. \u201cI care about the destruction and looting of ancient sites because I care about people, about human stories going back thousands of years, and about modern refugees and civilians who just want to survive and take care of their families,\u201d says Donovan.\n\nThe course material can be depressing, but Donovan also finds it motivating. \u201cI feel I am collecting tools with which I can, in some small part, help fix the problems,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s often painful, but things don\u2019t improve by turning away.\u201d"},{"title":"Rocking the new digs","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/rock-the-new-digs\/","tags":["alumni","arts-sciences"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"Back when nirvana was just a state of transcendence, campus-based KCMU was incubating a new kind of rock. Forty-some years later, Seattle\u2019s broadcast pioneer KEXP is settling into its new home.","content":"(UW homepage\/Columns magazine, March 2016)\n\nFrom a tiny student-run radio station with a 10-watt transmitter that barely broadcast past the Ave to a cultural force that reaches listeners worldwide, KEXP and its predecessor KCMU have been a staple of the Seattle music community for four decades. The mission: championing the underground sounds that deserve to be heard.\n\nNow, with new digs at the Seattle Center and a 30-year cooperative agreement with the UW, the station enters its next phase as an independent nonprofit with a $6 million budget and a 50-employee roster\u2014all while keeping sight of its role as Seattle\u2019s broadcast pioneer.\n\nThe year was 1970. America was in the thick of the Vietnam War, and students at the University of Washington\u2014and all across the nation\u2014were pushing for change. Students were up in arms about the war and fed up with racial injustice.\n\n\u201cYou have to go back in time and imagine,\u201d says Cliff Noonan, \u201972, a communication major who transferred from San Francisco to the UW, where his father was a teacher in the ROTC program. \u201cThere were student activities and protests and all these things going on, and none of that information was getting to the students; it just wasn\u2019t being processed. The only thing the UW had was The Daily, and I had worked at some stations back in California that were interviewing people from the Black Panthers; people who were very active in movements back in those days,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt that the students needed an outlet, a voice.\u201d\n\nMore specifically, Noonan felt the UW needed a student-run radio station. One where they could get much-needed firsthand experience that could lead to a future in the broadcast field. The cry for more practical experience was shared by Brent Wilcox, \u201974, John Kean, \u201972, and Tory Fiedler, \u201972. They joined with Noonan to bring their vision to life.\n\n\u201cWe got into it with a lot of hope and no backing, and luckily, we were able to present the idea in such a way that the dean and the Board of Regents could see it as an educational advancement,\u201d says Noonan. The deal? If the students could get the station licensed, the University would back it. \u201cThat\u2019s all we needed to hear,\u201d says Noonan. \u201cWe had to petition the Federal Communications Commission in Washington, D.C., and we had to find a space on the dial.\u201d The students found a Canadian treaty channel at 90.5 FM that didn\u2019t quite reach all the way down to Seattle and wrote to the commission, pleading to piggyback on top of that particular frequency.\n\nAs the clock ticked by, the students settled into the roles they would handle at the radio station. Kean spearheaded communications with the University and the FCC. Wilcox became the go-to engineering guy. Fiedler, who worked at The Daily, took on the role of news director, even getting an Associated Press wire newsfeed approved. Noonan worked his entertainment industry contacts in California, and began to build a music library. \u201cI started writing letters to Columbia Records and a few other labels to try to get them to send us recordings from their young, up-and-coming artists,\u201d he says. Most of the vinyl he received featured unknown artists\u2014the eventual hallmark of KCMU\/KEXP.\n\nA room on the third floor of the Communication Building had the bones to become a broadcast studio\u2014if only they could find the equipment. \u201cOne day I went out to Nathan Hale High School, which, believe it or not, actually had a radio station going for its students,\u201d Noonan says. \u201cThey were upgrading their transmitter, and I was able to convince them to give us their old one so at least we\u2019d have something to power up if we ever got the thing approved.\u201d He also picked up some old turntables from a radio station halfway to Canada.\n\nThey had the pieces, and thanks to a $2,500 grant from the Board of Regents, they had a powered transmitter, too, placed atop McMahon Hall. \u201cIt was a wonderful 10-watt transmitter that could broadcast all of 20 miles. It covered all of Lake Washington\u2014the fish had good sound,\u201d says Noonan, laughing. \u201cLooking back,\u201d Wilcox recalls, \u201cit\u2019s amazing it actually worked. We worried about it intensely.\u201d\n\nIt took the four students well over a year to transform the space that would eventually become the home of KCMU, named for the Communication Building. \u201cYou never saw four happier students than the day we got a letter from the FCC saying we were approved at that particular frequency. We went in thinking we could get it, but we weren\u2019t sure,\u201d says Noonan. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about four students who had an idea and literally built a radio station from the ground up.\u201d\n\nNoonan had the honor of hosting the first broadcast. \u201cI\u2019m on the microphone going, \u2018Is anybody there? Hello!\u2019 I had been on the air for about two hours, and I actually got a phone call from somebody across Lake Washington and he said \u2018Bro, this is great! Love your music! I have no idea who that artist was, but it was wonderful,\u2019\u201d says Noonan. \u201cI hung up the phone and said, \u2018God, somebody can actually hear us,\u2019 and that was a real excitement. It gave me goose bumps that we could actually get it done.\u201d\n\nThe station grew slowly. Wilcox remembers times when he\u2019d \u201cwork all night on a turntable that wouldn\u2019t run at a constant speed, and I\u2019d come home just in time to shower and go back to school and my dad would say, \u2018And you\u2019re getting paid how much for this?\u2019\u201d The four founders were devoted to the station, but graduation was fast approaching.\n\nThe University promised to keep KCMU alive, but the four students had no idea in what fashion. Noonan graduated and moved to California to start his career in broadcasting. \u201cI was able to walk away with some satisfaction thinking, \u2018Well, if it survives, at least there\u2019s some groundwork.\u2019\u201d He didn\u2019t really think about the station for 15 years or so, until someone mentioned a \u201creally cool\u201d radio station up in Seattle that he had to check out. That was in the late 1980s. Before the Internet, before streaming, the only way for him to hear the station was to physically get on a plane, fly to Seattle and check it out.\n\nBy then, the station had garnered acclaim from Billboard magazine, which touted KCMU as \u201cone of the most influential commercial-free stations in the country.\u201d The signal strength had grown from 10 watts to 400\u2014enough to broadcast the signal beyond campus. Members of Soundgarden and Mudhoney moonlighted as volunteer DJs, playing everything from indie rock to hip-hop. Just a few years later, Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain would knock on the station\u2019s door, with the demo for the grunge band\u2019s premiere single, \u201cLove Buzz,\u201d in hand. It was KCMU, after all, that first played Nirvana\u2019s debut album \u201cBleach\u201d on the air. KCMU had gone from a \u201cchewing-gum-and-barbed-wire station,\u201d says Wilcox, to a \u201cfull-fledged world leader in new music.\u201d KCMU continued to expand its programming, hiring full-time paid DJs. They moved to a new, larger home in the basement of Kane Hall.\n\nThat\u2019s when Kevin Cole, now KEXP\u2019s senior director of programming and host of \u201cThe Afternoon Show,\u201d got involved. Cole moved from Minneapolis to Seattle in 1998 to help Amazon.com launch its first product line after books: music. He\u2019d spent his entire adult life in that sphere, starting and managing record stores; spinning as the house DJ at Minneapolis\u2019 famed First Avenue Nightclub; launching his own radio station. His love of music led him to volunteer at KCMU, hosting a show on Sunday afternoons. \u201cIt was a typical college and community station\u2014a group of insanely passionate music and radio lovers making the best out of the gear, equipment and resources it had,\u201d recalls Cole. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t really a studio for bands to play in, so on the few occasions someone would play live, they usually gathered around the guest microphone in the DJ booth with their backs pressed up against the wall. It was scrappy!\u201d\n\nThat all changed when, in 2001, KCMU partnered with Paul Allen\u2019s Experience Music Project, relocated to Dexter Avenue and was renamed KEXP. \u201c[That move] really ushered in a new era of public service for the station\u2014an era built on the foundation of the \u201cwide and deep\u201d programming philosophy of KCMU, and expanding on that philosophy and expanding as an organization,\u201d says Cole. At that time, KEXP\u2019s mission was to enrich people\u2019s lives by applying technology to enhance the listening experience. In the following decade, KEXP was the first station to provide an uncompressed CD-quality stream online. The station developed real-time playlists, so the listener could see what was playing as opposed to waiting for the DJ to announce the set. It created a 14-day streaming archive, provided full-song podcasting and invested in video, so listeners could see the hundreds of bands that came through for a live set in their now-famous Christmas-light lit studio.\n\n\u201cPart of what sets KEXP apart is that our DJs have the freedom and responsibility to curate their own shows,\u201d says Cole. That helped launch the careers of major artists like Nirvana, Vampire Weekend, Fleet Foxes, Of Monsters and Men, The Head and The Heart, The Lumineers, Alt-J, Courtney Barnett and Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis\u2014just to name a few. \u201cIt\u2019s cool when an artist we play first breaks out in a big way, achieving superstardom or becoming part of the cultural zeitgeist, but like parents, we\u2019re equally proud of all the artists we\u2019ve played first and nurtured,\u201d says Cole.\n\nAnd now that the station has settled into a new studio at the Seattle Center\u2014its first broadcast was Dec. 9, 2015\u2014KEXP will reach an entirely new level of connectedness when it opens to the public on April 16. \u201cWhen we were at Dexter and Denny, pretty much every day a listener from somewhere outside of Seattle would knock on the door and ask for a tour,\u201d says Cole. \u201cWe love our connection with listeners, and we can\u2019t wait to have the KEXP community come in and experience it in person.\u201d The new home, which is nestled among Seattle arts staples such as the Experience Music Project, Seattle International Film Festival and the Vera Project (a music and arts center for youth), will allow visitors to sit in on in-studio performances and DJ-hosted salons.\n\n\u201cThe four of us, we just didn\u2019t know,\u201d says Noonan. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t know. We embarked on something, and it\u2019s turned into exactly what I was hoping for: a station integrated with the community. KEXP seems to have hit a niche in the world of music and education, and it\u2019s going to continue growing and expanding in that area with the new home. I\u2019m excited as hell about it.\u201d\n\n<em>Hannah Gilman, a UW copywriter, stays tuned to the UW\u2019s culture and history.<\/em>"},{"title":"\"March Madness\" distracts investors, disrupts market efficiency","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/march-madness-distracts-investors-disrupts-market-efficiency\/","tags":["faculty","foster-school-of-business"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"When the NCAA Division I Men\u2019s Basketball Tournament tips off each spring, productivity suffers and the financial markets feel the distraction, according to new research by associate accounting professor\u00a0Jacob Thornock.\n\n&nbsp;","content":"(Foster School of Business, March 2016)\n\nWhen the NCAA Division I Men\u2019s Basketball Tournament tips off each spring, workplaces across America become enthralled by its panoply of Cinderella stories and buzzer-beaters, the riveting display of sheer athletic possibility playing out, at least initially, during normal business hours.\n\nNot surprisingly, productivity suffers during \u201cMarch Madness.\u201d\n\nThe financial markets feel the distraction, too, according to new research by <a href=\"http:\/\/foster.uw.edu\/faculty-research\/directory\/jake-thornock\/\">Jacob Thornock<\/a>, an associate professor of accounting at the University of Washington Foster School of Business.\n\nThornock\u2019s study of investor activity during more than a decade of NCAA tournaments demonstrates that the volume of trading drops markedly during the first round of March Madness, and the market response to earnings news is measurably muted.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that March Madness is a distraction to labor and productivity,\u201d Thornock says. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t expect to find the same distraction affecting financial analysts and investors\u2014highly educated and motivated professionals who have considerable amounts of money on the line.\u201d\n\n<strong>Universal distraction<\/strong>\n\nEvery march, an NCAA selection committee invites 68 college men\u2019s basketball teams from its Division I member schools to compete in the three-week, single-elimination tournament to decide the national champion.\n\nThis generates enormous interest and excitement. According to the NCAA, live broadcast of the 2015 tourney averaged 11.3 million viewers across four television channels. Another 17.8 million hours of action were consumed via live video stream on computers and mobile devices. March Madness inspired 350 million social media impressions.\n\nAnd an estimated 40 million Americans filled out tournament brackets in competitions to see who can predict the results most accurately. WalletHub estimates that $12 billion is wagered on the tournament each year.\n\nAll of this adds up to a great deal of workplace distraction\u2014especially during the tourney\u2019s first round of 32 games that play out over a Thursday and Friday, with much of the action unfolding during the workday.\n\nThis distraction takes a toll. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.challengergray.com\/press\/press-releases\/employers-brace-march-madness\">A study<\/a> by Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas estimates that U.S. businesses will pay nearly $4 billion in wages\u00a0to\u00a0workers preoccupied by the opening rounds of this year\u2019s tournament.\n\nCount Thornock and co-author Michael Drake of BYU among the masses distracted by March Madness.\n\nWhile working toward their doctorate degrees, Thornock and Drake would find themselves each March streaming games and obsessing over brackets, match-ups, predictions and upsets. \u201cWe noticed how distracted we were during March Madness,\u201d Thornock says. \u201cAnd we wondered if investors get distracted, too.\u201d\n\n<strong>Clean laboratory<\/strong>\n\nThey also realized that March Madness itself made a nearly perfect laboratory for the study of investor distraction. It is an annually recurring event that draws massive popular attention and plays out, at least in part, during trading hours.\n\nAnd unlike other distracting events\u2014such as a national election, terrorist attack or competing earnings announcements\u2014the NCAA tourney has no implications on the financial markets. Florida Gulf Coast upsetting Georgetown or Weber State shocking North Carolina should have no bearing on securities pricing.\n\n\u201cMarch Madness provides a clean test of distraction that is not confounded by other political or economic factors that could also cause market reaction to be muted,\u201d Thornock says.\n\n<strong>Muted response<\/strong>\n\nUsing this clean test, Thornock, Drake and Kurt Gee of Stanford University compared market activity on the Thursdays and Fridays of NCAA tournament opening rounds (from 2000-2012) to Thursdays and Fridays outside of the tourney.\n\nThe most obvious evidence of distraction was in the volume of trading,\u00a0which\u00a0was significantly reduced for earnings released\u00a0on March Madness days.\n\nBut the\u00a0weekday diversion\u00a0of college hoops also showed up in the form of abnormal investor response to earnings news. When firms disclosed earnings during the opening round of the tournament, market reaction was comparably muted.\n\nSo for instance, if a company\u2019s earnings come in five percent over analyst projections, we\u2019d expect to see the news send share prices immediately upward by an appropriate amount\u2014under normal circumstances.\n\nDuring March Madness, however,\u00a0a critical mass of\u00a0investors\u00a0becomes distracted enough to\u00a0make the overall market react more slowly to earnings announcements, with more \u201cdrift\u201d in prices in the direction of the earnings signal.\n\n\u201cIn other words,\u201d Thornock says, \u201cthe reaction is incomplete. We expect the market to adjust quickly and completely to incorporate good or bad earnings news into price. Instead, we find that its response is slow and incomplete.\u201d\n\n<strong>The humanity of markets<\/strong>\n\nThornock emphasizes that this finding does not contain a get-rich-scheme for investors who remain attentive to earnings news while the masses obsess on college basketball games.\n\nIt also does not suggest a market dysfunction that should be cause for any real concern.\n\nBut it does reveal a systematic\u2014though minor\u2014flaw in market efficiency.\n\n\u201cThere is a class of economist that believes markets are perfectly efficient, that they allocate resources quickly and efficiently, that there are too many rational economic agents with strong incentives to ever let distraction affect pricing,\u201d Thornock says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s somewhat credible. I\u2019m a believer in markets.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, a market is made up of humans. And in this paper we are able to <em>cleanly<\/em> capture that human element. It turns out that the market likes to watch a little basketball and gets distracted by March Madness just like everyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2576018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">March Market Madness: The Impact of Value-Irrelevant Events on the Market Pricing of Earnings News<\/a>\u201d is forthcoming in the journal <a href=\"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1911-3846.12149\/abstract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Contemporary Accounting Research<\/em><\/a>."},{"title":"Digital Future Lab: Sandbox for neurodiversity","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/digital-future-lab-sandbox-for-neurodiversity\/","tags":["faculty","bothell"],"pillars":["innovation"],"image":"","excerpt":"UW Bothell's Digital Future Lab has created a unique environment that welcomes all into the world of computing.","content":"(UW Bothell, March 2016)\n\nUniversity of Washington Bothell\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/digitalfuturelab.com\/\">Digital Future Lab<\/a> champions an environment students and staff refer to as \"radical diversity\u201d-- bringing more women and people of color into computing as well as welcoming students outside the typical software majors and personalities.\n\nIn the interactive media studio, students learn computer and business skills while creating video games \u2013 real, complicated, professionally produced games.\n\n\u201cThe games are just the sandbox,\u201d says Jason Pace, executive director of the lab. It\u2019s the people and the way they play in the sandbox that\u2019s significant.\n\nPace founded the Digital Future Lab in 2012, following 15 years at Microsoft where he was a creative director and lead producer for the Halo franchise on Xbox. He\u2019s an artist who\u2019s passionate about bringing a diversity of thought to game development.\n<div>\n\n\u201cWhat that boils down to is when we talk about diversity it's not just about these external markers like, \u2018I need more women in my company\u2019 or \u2018I need more people of color,' although those notions of diversity are, of course, incredibly important,\" Pace said. \u201cTrue diversity also includes making space for different kinds of thinkers, and that means valuing different backgrounds and points of view. When you intentionally recruit to maximize difference, that's when the creative process becomes really interesting.\u201d\n\nAlong with musicians and artists, the neurodiversity mix may include people with special traits \u2013 who are empathetic, loving or kind to animals \u2013 and people with conditions on the autistic spectrum or even battling depression.\n\n\u201cWe pull in different kinds of people from campus,\u201d says Aina Braxton, the lab\u2019s program coordinator.

And, graduates are welcomed into jobs because they are well-trained to work in teams, manage workflow and express themselves to colleagues, Braxton adds.\n\nThe lab rolled out its first game in 2015 \u2013 just in time for Halloween. Ghostlight Manor is an all-age puzzle game featuring a cast of monsters on 51 levels. Initially designed for mobile devices, the computer version will be available for UW Bothell students to test this spring.\n\nTwo more games are in the pipeline.

Nearby buildings were buried, and 57 people were killed. A serene and picturesque landscape had turned terrifyingly barren.\n\nBut researchers have since found a silver lining: the eruption created a great natural experiment. The federal government designated the mountain a national monument, which allowed plants and animals to return naturally \u2014 rather than being placed there by people.\n\n\u201cThe volcano reset everything to zero,\u201d said Cynthia Chang, an assistant professor of biology at UW Bothell. \u201cWhen everything is reset, what is able to come in? What is able to establish? And what is able to spread?\u201d\n\nChang, who finished up her post-doc at UW Seattle in 2014, recently took over three decades of Mount St. Helens data from Roger del Moral, a retiring UW biology professor. The data reveals how, year by year, life has returned from scratch.\n\nThe research is incredibly time-intensive. Last summer, Chang and an undergraduate researcher camped out on the mountain for five days each week (they came back on weekends for water, supplies, and showers). They documented which species of plants were growing, keeping an eye out for diversity.\n\n\u201cIn general, the idea is that if you have more diversity, then more niches are occupied, so they have more functions,\u201d Chang said. \u201cThey can facilitate each other and increase overall uptake of resources, or even deal with disturbance like climate change, drought, fire and invasive species.\u201d\n\nOne example of a niche role is a nitrogen-fixing plant, such as a legume (peanuts, soybeans, lentils, etc.). Nitrogen is necessary for all plants to live \u2014 that\u2019s why you need to add fertilizer to your garden \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t exist in volcanic soil. Legumes attract nitrogen to an area, which allows other plants to come in and thrive.\n\nAs for as legumes go, Chang is particularly fond of lupines. They were the first plant to colonize Mount St. Helens after the eruption (see\u00a0a photo she took\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/wholeu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/lupin.jpg\">here<\/a>).\n\nChang takes her data back to the classroom at UW Bothell, where she co-teaches a biology-inspired math class with Associate Professor Robin Angotti.

Work by Sarah Eddy, Sara Brownell and Mary Pat Wenderoth (Eddy et al. 2014)<sup>1<\/sup>, his colleagues in the Biology Education Research Group at the UW, had revealed an achievement gap that favors males as top performers, a phenomenon that could affect\u00a0student self-confidence\u2014particularly of females\u2014thus\u00a0influencing their persistence in their discipline. The researchers observed this gender achievement gap, in addition to a participation gap, even in classes where males were outnumbered by females three-to-two. Although their research focused on introductory biology classes, the researchers believe the dynamic may be at play in other science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) classes and throughout the University as well.\n\nWiggins joined colleagues Dan Grunspan, a doctoral student in anthropology performing graduate work on social aspects of learning, and Eddy, then a post-doctoral student heavily involved in gender equity issues in the classroom, to further understand what was happening. Their research revealed another bias in who students perceive as knowledgeable in the class.\n<h3>The research: How Wiggins and colleagues reached their conclusions<\/h3>\nTo conduct social network analysis, Wiggins and colleagues began\u00a0by asking students to list who in the class they predict will be a particularly strong student. \u201cJust because a student knows someone doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re willing to say \u2018I think they know the material,\u2019\u201d notes Wiggins. No inequality was evident when the question was asked at the beginning of the quarter, but as the students answered the same question after each of four exams throughout the term, more males than females were\u00a0listed as strong students\u2014even in a course where females significantly outnumbered males.\n\nAnalysis of the data revealed that males were much more likely to nominate other males, while women were equally nominating males and females who were perceived to receive high grades and often speak up in class. \u201cFemales seem to nominate equitably based on who you would expect [from actual performance], whereas males over-nominate other males,\u201d says Grunspan.\u00a0 This work has recently been published in <a href=\"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0148405\">PLOS ONE<\/a>, and the larger team includes former Biology Education Postdoc Sara Brownell, UW Biology Principal Lecturer Alison Crowe and UW Anthropology Associate Professor Steven Goodreau<sup>2<\/sup>.\n<h3>What instructors can do to minimize\u00a0the gender gap<\/h3>\nDespite the complexities of a classroom environment, the researchers say their data highlight broad issues that can largely be addressed through small tweaks in teaching methods.\n<h4><strong>Random calling helps address the common problem of implicit bias<\/strong><\/h4>\nResearch on teaching has shown that gender biases commonly creep in to how instructors run their classes. \u201cAs an instructor, it\u2019s likely that I don\u2019t call on people in a gender-equitable way, even if I\u2019m thinking about it, even if I have a lot of experience,\u201d says Wiggins. \u201cIf you want to make classes more gender equitable, you have to take your own biases out of it.\u201d Therefore, Wiggins regularly employs a method known as random call to improve equity in class participation.\u00a0It is a method long used in teaching,\u00a0and the work of Eddy, Brownell and Wenderoth (2014) confirmed that random calling rather than choosing students or asking for volunteers can also equalize the environment of the college classroom. \u201cWhere everybody is equally likely to be called on, everyone is more active. Students can\u2019t avoid being called on by staying in the back,\u201d Wiggins says. Involving more students beyond those who are naturally more inclined to be \u201coutspoken\u201d\u2014a measure the researchers determined by asking instructors to rank students they recalled as speaking up most in class\u2014can potentially influence the perceptions of other students about who is doing well in the class, one element affecting self-confidence. \u201cBut more importantly, it randomizes who is doing the talking,\u201d notes Wiggins. \u201cIt may help to alleviate this prestige gap that we see.\u201d\n<h4><strong>Random calling provides more equitable opportunities for positive reinforcement<\/strong><\/h4>\nWomen in particular can benefit from seeing more women speak up with the right answer or successfully handle being wrong\u2014with no adverse effects on males in the classroom.\u00a0As students transition into a career, beginning with an introductory biology class, women are particularly vulnerable to threats to their self-confidence, which is closely linked to persistence in STEM and is known to be heavily influenced by social interactions such as classroom participation. Getting an answer right or wrong in an introductory biology class may seem like a small thing to affect a student\u2019s persistence in a chosen field, but, \u201cIt\u2019s the day-to-day interactions that matter,\u201d explains Eddy. \u201cThe minute someone defers to you, you feel like you\u2019re an expert.\u201d\n<h4><strong>Moving students from a \u201cfixed mindset\u201d about intelligence to a \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d<\/strong><\/h4>\nPersistence and confidence are also closely linked to what students believe about their ability to grow their intellectual capacity and learn from being wrong. Noted psychologist and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/psychology.stanford.edu\/cdweck\">Stanford researcher Carol Dweck<\/a>\u00a0has shown that simple interventions, such as asking people to reflect and write about their values and motivations, can change people\u2019s mindset, and \u201crewire\u201d the brain to a growth mindset. \u201cOne hypothesis is that perhaps more females are coming in with a fixed mindset while more males are coming in with a growth mindset,\u201d says Grunspan. Moving forward, the UW researchers plan to test the effects of interventions on introductory biology classes.\n<h3>Connecting the classroom environment to the outside world<\/h3>\nDigging deeper into the research revealed consistent gender gaps in both student perception and achievement, even when controlling for student grades coming into the class. \u201cBy the end of your college career, you may have seen this pattern happen 20 or 30 times, and those same people you see in all your classes may very easily be doing hiring or firing later,\u201d says Wiggins.\n\nAs Wiggins, Grunspan and Eddy realized they were seeing evidence of invisible but powerful forces affecting their students, they began to understand how persistent negative stereotypes can be. \u201cWe tend to think our classrooms are distinct from society, but the processes from our larger society are being brought into the classroom. Unless we can actively disrupt them, it will continue,\u201d says Eddy.\n\nEddy joins Wiggins and Grunspan in viewing classroom data as an important tool to interrupt the negative processes they observed. \u201cProfessors typically have the ability to look back at numbers and performance in a class. Start prying a little deeper and really assess what\u2019s going on in each classroom,\u201d advises Grunspan. If the data suggest these common problems are affecting the performance of your students, consider ways you can make space in your classroom for equitable opportunities and inclusion. \u201cAs instructors, that\u2019s where we have leverage,\u201d says Wiggins. \u201cWe want to make sure we run the class in a way that engages everyone, and this is just one example of changing our teaching to serve diverse students.\u201d\n<h3>Get more details<\/h3>\nFind out how Ben Wiggins incorporates <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/trends\/what-to-know-when-using-random-call\/\">random calling<\/a>\u00a0into his classroom.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>References<\/h4>\n<sup>1<\/sup>Eddy, Sarah L., Sara E.

She came to the UW to lay the foundation for a career as a child psychologist, and through her experience at MultiModal Health, she developed a more nuanced understanding of trauma of all kinds.\n\n\u201cI learned a lot about the actual, physical brain connections you make while playing these games,\u201d says Chambers, a double major in psychology, and early childhood and family studies. \u201cIt also helped me understand on a deeper level how any kind of traumatic experience can affect a child\u2019s development.\u201d\n\nHer internship experience included researching occupational therapy techniques, examining family influence on the rehabilitation process, experimenting with new devices and even creating virtual illustrations.\n\nThrough the process of working with colleagues in neurobiology and rehabilitative medicine, she simultaneously sharpened and expanded her focus.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m now interested in how the whole realm of development comes together: socioemotional, cognitive, memory and physical.\u201d\n\nSince her internship ended, Chambers has taken the reins on a research project of her own. Under the mentorship of Dr. Kate McLaughlin, principal investigator of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stressdevelopmentlab.org\/\">UW\u2019s Stress and Development Lab<\/a>, she is currently analyzing how stress influences emotional development in children\u2014and how that, in turn, influences depression and anxiety.\n\nAs she prepares for the rigors of graduate studies in the fall, Chambers is grateful for the scholarship-supported experience that helped pave the way to her future.\n\n\u201cThe CoMotion Mary Gates Innovation Scholarship gave me the push I needed to launch myself into research,\u201d she says. \u201cIt helped me realize that this is what I want to do.\u201d\n<h2>CoMotion Mary Gates Innovation Scholars<\/h2>\nThe <a href=\"http:\/\/comotion.uw.edu\/comotion-mary-gates-innovation-scholars\">CoMotion Mary Gates Innovation Scholarship<\/a> pairs driven students with UW startup initiatives through a full-time summer internship.\n\nInnovation scholars work with up-and-coming innovators and entrepreneurs, addressing the grand challenges of our time.

She and her family picked whatever was in season: cherries, asparagus, apples. Life was hard, she says. \u201cWe would spend most of our time just working, working, working.\u201d<\/small>\n\n<small>Though Reyna endured many hardships as a child, there was an upside: She realized that she had a strong passion for helping others. She was a committed student, and even on days she worked in the fields, she\u2019d spend her lunch breaks tutoring her struggling classmates in reading and math.<\/small>\n\n<small>From tutor to educator, Reyna now teaches elementary and community college classes. She even spent time running an after-school program for troubled girls; years ago, a visit to that program kindled Chambers\u2019 interest in child psychology. After watching her mother give extra attention to the students who needed it most \u2014 from making them laugh to fostering active learning \u2014\u00a0Chambers was inspired to help troubled children just like them.<\/small>\n\n<small>\u201cVictoria\u2019s going to go all the way to get her doctorate, to be the first doctor in our family,\u201d says Reyna. \u201cI know she can do it, and she knows she can do it.

Pathways to Promise is UW Tacoma\u2019s expanding network of partnerships aimed at creating college readiness and a college-going culture among the region\u2019s teens, developed as part of the university\u2019s urban-serving mission.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>In 2014, the program grew from two partnerships with Tacoma Public Schools and Puyallup School District (which started in 2013) to include partnerships with Federal Way School District (begun in spring of 2014) and Franklin Pierce and Bethel School Districts (begun in autumn 2014). Other partnerships are being explored for 2015.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>And as the program expands, it is showing results.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><strong>What is Pathways to Promise?<\/strong><\/div>\n<div>\u00a0<span class=\"img-caption caption-right\">Pathways to Promise aims to create college readiness and a college-going culture in South Sound teenagers.\u00a0<\/span>Pathways to Promise works to create a college-going culture in local schools and organizations \u2013 not focused just on UW Tacoma, but considering any post-secondary education \u2013 and to develop college readiness in these students.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>In return, it gives students in partner districts and organizations the opportunity to enter UW Tacoma by providing transparent admissions criteria, making the college application process less opaque. Students in partner districts that meet the minimum course requirements (CADRs, or College Academic Distribution Requirements), have a GPA of 2.7 or higher, score 480 or higher on each section of the SAT or 21 or higher on the ACT, submit a complete application including a well-written personal statement, and enroll at UW Tacoma immediately following their senior year will have assured admission to a high-quality UW Tacoma education.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>\u201cThe threshold is a signal of preparation,\u201d Smith says of these criteria.

The program aims to prompt students to think seriously about their futures and have the skills for either college or a career.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>\u201cPathways to Promise is also about helping students make informed decisions,\u201d says Amanda Bruner, UW Tacoma\u2019s director of student transition programs. \u201cWe want students to understand the landscape of choices that are available to them.\u201d<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><strong>Growing Collaborations<\/strong><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"img-caption caption-right\">Teens participate in the Math Science Leadership program with UW Tacoma, another part of the work done by UW Tacoma to prepare local high school students for college.<\/span>What does Pathways to Promise look like in practice, going into its third year?<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>UW Tacoma and its partners have found that it looks a little different in each school. Each high school is assigned a specific UW Tacoma admissions representative who develops programs tailored to the school\u2019s needs. At some schools, that might be a cultural night; at others, it could be workshops for ninth and tenth grade students about the college application process.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>\u201cOne thing the partnership allows us to do is develop closer relationships with the counselors and career centers,\u201d says Bruner. UW Tacoma representatives \u201creally get to know the culture of each building.\u201d<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>In all partner districts, UW Tacoma provides planning tools, like checklists and step-by-step guides to applying for college. Advisors put on workshops for college applications and writing the college essay (no easy task for any high school student). This year, UW Tacoma has added an outreach specialist who focuses on getting middle school students ready and excited for college, to plant the seed \u201cthat college is an option or a dream,\u201d says Smith.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Pathways to Promise also brings students from partner districts for special visits to the UW Tacoma campus, giving them a \u201cday in the life of a college student,\u201d Smith says, as they sit in on classes, talk with current students and tour the campus.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The program also hosts celebrations at partner schools for students admitted to UW Tacoma. Last March, Governor Jay Inslee visited Stadium High School as part of the festivities.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>These new partnerships have posed their own unique hurdles. Franklin Pierce and Bethel School Districts encompass many students who live in rural areas. \u201cWe\u2019re a very urban campus, but we\u2019re really close to rural areas,\u201d points out Bruner. This makes visits to UW Tacoma more difficult for these students, so it is more important that UW Tacoma representatives are able to meet the students where they are, visiting high schools often.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><strong>Measuring Results<\/strong><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"img-caption caption-right\">Other students participate in the Math Science Leadership program.\u00a0<\/span>As the program rounds the corner on three years, its results are becoming more apparent.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Pathways to Promise uses a rubric to measure college-going culture in partner school districts. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be able to measure how elements of college going culture are shifting over time,\u201d says Bruner. At the same time, the team is also looking qualitatively at how UW Tacoma can contribute to capacity in its partners.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Since the program began, UW Tacoma has seen what Smith calls a \u201csignificant increase\u201d in the number of applications from Tacoma Public Schools and Puyallup School District, going from a total of 191 applicants before the partnerships began to 280 applicants in 2014.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><strong>Community Partners<\/strong><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Other UW Tacoma programs work to bolster the college-going culture fostered in local schools.

A sudden spike in the minimum wage for childcare workers further tightened the financial screws. And, as several other long-time providers in the community recently closed their doors, demand for Tiny Tots\u2019 affordable services was ever growing in a neighborhood largely left behind in Seattle\u2019s\u00a0current economic\u00a0boom.\n\nA community lifeline for nearly five decades, Tiny Tots needed to consider what it would take to survive the next year, let alone the next 50.\n\n\u201cWhatever came up, we always figured it out,\u201d says Jacqualine Boles, director of family and health services at Tiny Tots. \u201cBut then the reality hit us: what we\u2019re doing has to be sustained or we won\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\nThe Tiny Tots staff excelled at care and education (and ad hoc problem solving). But what they needed was a long-term strategic plan. For this, they needed help.\n\n<strong>Help arrives<\/strong>\n\nA bit of good fortune led Tiny Tots to the <a href=\"http:\/\/foster.uw.edu\/centers\/consulting-and-business-development-center\/\">Consulting and Business Development Center<\/a> at the University of Washington Foster School of Business.\n\nThe Center connected Boles and executive director Angelia Maxie with its core Student Consulting program. The program deploys small teams of Foster students\u2014guided by mentors from the Seattle Rotary Club and professional advisors from local consulting firms\u2014to help small businesses in under-served communities address a wide range of business challenges and opportunities.\n\nFor Tiny Tots, the challenge was finding firmer financial footing to sustain their essential presence in the community.\n\nLast winter, a team of Foster undergraduates performed a comprehensive review of the organization, from mission statement to policies to financials to marketing. They produced a strategic plan that streamlined operations, clarified financial accounting, and recommended more robust marketing of their deep well of life-changing stories.\n\nThey convinced the non-profit to act like a business.\n\n\u201cWe were a mom-and-pop shop for many years,\u201d Boles says. \u201cThe students helped us see that we are not just taking care of kids. We have a real business. And we have got to compete, market ourselves, be aggressive.\u201d\n\n<strong>Culture of asking<\/strong>\n\nBut the students\u2019 business analysis also identified a missed opportunity to act like a non-profit: fundraising.\n\n\u201cThey made us realize that we didn\u2019t have a culture of asking,\u201d Boles says. \u201cWe never asked people for anything. It really has changed our whole way of thinking.\u201d\n\nSince the project closed, Tiny Tots has been regularly reaching out within and beyond its community. Asking for help.\n\nAnd people are responding. Parents contribute whatever and however they can to their children\u2019s classrooms. The board is growing more active,\u00a0sparked by\u00a0new recruits from the larger business community. Microsoft employees, served a soul-food lunch while beautifying Tiny Tots facilities during\u00a0last year\u2019s United Way Day of Caring, forked over $1,600 on the spot\u2014with a company match\u2014when Boles asked for contributions. And employees and friends are participating in the \u201cFind 100 ways to love Tiny Tots\u201d campaign of viral fundraising.\n\nThe biggest ask of all was the organization\u2019s first-ever fundraising breakfast in December, keynoted by the owner of the Seattle Reign (who was there because Maxie asked).\n\nIt\u2019s early to measure the impact of the Foster students working through the Consulting and Business Development Center. But Boles and Maxie are optimistic and energized.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a big shift in our culture,\u201d Boles says. \u201cOur founder just wanted to take care of some kids, and she did that well. But now we are figuring out all of the pieces so that we will be here in 100 years.\n\n\u201cIt was hurtful to see some of the long-time childcare providers in the community close after so many years. They just couldn\u2019t survive any more. They didn\u2019t get a Foster School team. I\u2019m so grateful that they came and are helping us figure it out.\u201d\n\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gdlr-single-blog-tag\"><\/div>"},{"title":"Quality childcare close to campus","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/quality-childcare-close-to-campus\/","tags":["undergraduate-student","tacoma"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"The Muse hopes to change the local landscape for childcare while providing University of Washington Tacoma students, faculty and staff with greater flexibility.","content":"(UW Tacoma, January 2016)\n\nLife is about to get a little easier for University of Washington Tacoma student Shanett\u2019 McBride.\u00a0 Until now the senior in business management relied on family to provide childcare for her three-year-old daughter.\u00a0 \u201cIt was always a week to week thing,\u201d says McBride.\n\nMcBride searched the Tacoma area for childcare that would be a good fit for her daughter.\u00a0 She first heard about<em>The Muse: A Childcare Center<\/em> from her pediatrician.\u00a0 McBride visited the facility and was struck by the openness of the space.\u00a0 \u201cMy daughter is super energetic, if she\u2019s closed in a room too long she\u2019ll go crazy,\u201d says McBride.\n\n<em>The Muse <\/em>is grounded in the Reggio Emilia approach which encourages exploration and discovery.\u00a0 \u201cWe have a very strong image of the child, that they\u2019re capable of guiding their learning journeys and need to help facilitate what they\u2019re interested in,\u201d says Children\u2019s Museum of Tacoma Executive Director Tanya Andrews.\n\n<em>The Muse <\/em>is a collaboration between the Children\u2019s Museum and UW Tacoma.\u00a0 Planning for <em>The Muse <\/em>began a few years ago.\u00a0 The campus\u2019s late Chancellor Debra Freidman spearheaded the initiative after learning that childcare and a fitness center were the two highest priorities for students.\n\nProviding access to childcare is only part of the equation.\u00a0 The other part is helping students financially.\u00a0 The University\u2019s Childcare Assistance Program offers funding to qualifying students to pay for childcare.\u00a0 Scholarships will also be available to <em>The Muse<\/em> through a generous donation from the Bamford Foundation.\n\nThe center is slated to open in early February and is licensed to provide care for up to 70 children.\u00a0 McBride, who currently does her homework late at night after her daughter goes to sleep, is looking forward to a more normal schedule.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to stay on campus and get my work done.\u201d\n\nBecause of its proximity to campus, McBride can also visit her daughter during breaks.\u00a0 <em>The Muse <\/em>Director Christina Aubel welcomes participation from parents. \u201cWe see this as a partnership between the teacher, family, and child,\u201d says Aubel.\n\nAubel has been working in the Reggio Emila model for 15 years.\u00a0 She has a Masters in Curriculum &amp; Instruction Teaching.\u00a0 Most of the staff at the facility has college degrees and experience working with young children.\n\n<em>The Muse<\/em> is situated on the bottom floor of the Children\u2019s Museum.\u00a0 Inside there\u2019s a kitchen, dining area, art space, and three homerooms.\u00a0 The homerooms are partitioned but children are free to move as they please.\n\nThe center is open from 7 am to 6 pm Monday through Friday.\u00a0 The typical day starts with breakfast which, like all meals at <em>The Muse<\/em>, is served family style.\u00a0 Children are active participants in the process.

When it's not, it's a big news story (as officials in Flint, Michigan recently learned). That\u2019s not the case in some parts of the world, as UW alumnus Eric Stowe discovered when he visited orphanages in China while working for a U.S. adoption agency.\n\n\u201cThe tourist hotels and the KFCs and Starbucks in China all had safe water, but the orphanages didn\u2019t,\u201d recalls Stowe (BA, interdisciplinary arts and sciences, 2001; MA, international studies, 2003). \u201cI thought there must be a way to take what works for those restaurants and hotels\u2014their technology, supply chains, and standards\u2014and bring it to orphanages.\u201d That idea led Stowe to found <a href=\"http:\/\/splash.org\/\">Splash<\/a>, a nonprofit that now provides safe water to hundreds of thousands of children living in urban poverty in Asia and Africa.\n\nClean water was not something Stowe pondered as an undergraduate at UW Tacoma, or as a graduate student in the Jackson School of International Studies, where his emphasis was China Studies. But he always had an interest in social justice movements\u2014and he believes that Splash is all about social justice.\n\n\u201cOur work is first and foremost about equity, ensuring that the children in the cities where we work have the same opportunities around safe water that my own kids take for granted,\u201d says Stowe. \u201cWater is one of the key ingredients of a healthy child and a functioning society.\u201d\n\nStowe was traveling to Asia regularly for his adoption agency work when he decided to tackle the safe water issue. He bought high-quality water filtration equipment at a discount in the U.S., hauled it to Asia in his suitcases, and installed it in orphanages with approval from the Chinese government. But chipping away at the problem in this piecemeal fashion became frustrating. \u201cThere were a lot of people doing adoption work but very few doing safe water for children,\u201d says Stowe, \u201cso I left my adoption agency job to start Splash.\u201d\n<div class=\"content\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"content\">With support from individuals\u00a0and foundations, Splash\u00a0now has a staff of 70 and a presence in eight countries: China, Nepal, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Bangladesh, India, and Ethiopia.\u00a0 In China, the focus continues to be orphanages; Stowe anticipates that all of China\u2019s orphanages\u20141,200 facilities spanning 31 provinces\u2014will have safe water by the end of 2017. At that point Splash will transfer maintenance to the Chinese government, which has collaborated throughout the process. \u201cWe\u2019ve created the network, the supply chains, and the inventory to ensure that safe water is at every orphanage,\u201d says Stowe. \u201cNow it\u2019s the government\u2019s time to take over and ensure that those systems keep going for decades.\u201d<\/div>\n<div class=\"content\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"content\">\n\nIn other countries, Splash focuses on a single city and reaches out to all facilities\u2014schools, pediatric hospitals, street shelters\u2014that serve children in urban poverty. Along with providing safe water, Splash promotes hand washing and toileting, also essential for disease prevention. \u201cThose three in combination have the greatest impact,\u201d says Stowe. \u201cYou lose one and you lose significant degrees of impact overall.\u201d Hygiene education can be challenging, so Splash has developed fun, hands-on curricula. \u201cGetting kids to wash their hands and getting schools to support that is significantly harder than you might imagine,\u201d says Stowe. \u201cOur water projects are easy in comparison.\u201d\n\nAlthough Splash is headquartered in Seattle, most staff live and work in the countries served. All international staff are local to their region, as are the government, corporate, and NGO partners for each project. Local ownership is critical, since Splash plans to hand over the reins once projects are established.\n\n\u201cTo do our best work, we have to build Splash to be taken over by local businesses that are funded by local governments and supported by local communities,\u201d says Stowe. \u201cPhilanthropy at its best acts as a bridge to a long-term solution, rather than acting as the solution itself.\u201d In Thailand, a local corporation is poised to continue Splash\u2019s work; in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Rural Action Committee (BRAC)\u2014the largest NGO in the world\u2014will do the same. \u201cWe\u2019re sharing all our propriety knowledge with them, showing them what we do really well, and getting them past all the headaches and hiccups we went through,\u201d says Stowe. \u201cAnd then we\u2019re going to let them do it far better.\u201d\n\nThat absence of ego\u2014and commitment to local ownership\u2014is a hallmark of Stowe and his nonprofit. \u201cWe\u2019re an odd duck in the NGO sector,\u201d says Stowe. \u201cNGOs tend to be a territorial, secretive, isolated bunch. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me.

His current home is Turkmenistan, where he serves as U.S. Ambassador.\n\nTurkmenistan was not on the world map when Mustard (BA, Slavic Languages &amp; Literatures, Political Science, 1978) was starting his career. It was part of the vast Soviet Union. But with neighbors that include Iran and Afghanistan, Turkmenistan is now a critical player in Central Asia\u2014even if many Americans are unfamiliar with it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough neighborhood, and both the U.S. and the Turkmen recognize that,\u201d says Mustard. \u201cTurkmenistan\u2019s efforts are pivotal to supporting regional stability, including provision of much assistance to Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nMustard\u2019s UW majors in political science and Slavic languages and literatures seem a perfect fit for his current role. He began studying Russian and German at Grays Harbor College in Aberdeen\u2014those were the only languages offered\u2014and continued with Russian after transferring to the UW. He grew to love Russian literature, but initially he studied the language for a less lofty reason.\n\n\u201cTo graduate in poli sci you needed either a foreign language or statistics, and I thought learning Russian would be easier than statistics,\u201d admits Mustard. His theory was later tested at the University of Illinois, where statistics was required for his master\u2019s degree in agricultural economics. \u201cI discovered I was right,\u201d he jokes. \u201cRussian <em>is<\/em> easier than statistics.\u201d\n\nAll of Mustard\u2019s academic choices furthered his goal of working abroad. He pursued his graduate degree after meeting the agricultural attach\u00e9 from the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union, who commented that Mustard\u2019s farm background and fluency in Russian would make him a great candidate for the Foreign Agricultural Service\u2014if he got a master\u2019s in agricultural economics.\n\nMustard joined FAS as an agricultural economist in 1982; over the next 30 years he rose to FAS\u2019s highest rank. With multiple postings in Slavic countries, his background in Russian language and literature proved invaluable.\n\n\u201cThe fact that my UW professors and my Russian House \u2018parents\u2019 taught me to speak fluent Russian has been an enormous strength,\u201d he says. \u201cThe biggest surprise, when I arrived for my first tour of duty in Moscow in 1986, was how often Russians will probe your knowledge of Russian literature to see if you are someone to be taken seriously as an intellectual or if you can be safely disregarded as a lightweight. If you don\u2019t respond correctly, your credibility is shot.\u00a0 If you do respond correctly, your stock rises.\u201d\n\nIn the Foreign Agricultural Service, Mustard\u2019s work involved gathering information about international food production, promoting the export of U.S. agricultural products, and helping negotiate access to foreign markets. In times of regional upheaval, he also provided food assistance and other aid.\u00a0In 1991,\u00a0Mustard was part of a team that evaluated the Soviet food situation and recommended actions to ensure adequate food for the coming winter\u2014at the request of President Mikhail Gorbachev, who had recently\u00a0returned to Moscow after surviving an attempted coup by government hardliners.\u00a0\u201cThe world\u2019s second largest nuclear power was asking us for help, and I had the honor of participating in that set of missions,\u201d says Mustard.\n\nEven more memorable were efforts to aid Bosnian refugees displaced by war in the 1990s. In addition to assuring delivery of wheat and cooking oil to Bosnia, Mustard collaborated with private charities and NGOs to provide microcredit for Bosnian war widows, farmer credit to get food production restarted, and other assistance to rebuild the economy. \u201cThat was some of the most satisfying work of my diplomatic career,\u201d says Mustard. \u201cTo succeed at this, I had to understand the Balkans and the ethnic, cultural, and religious tensions in the region, and thus drew heavily on what I had learned at the UW.\u201d\n\nAll those experiences prepared Mustard for his greatest challenge yet, serving as U.S. Ambassador to Turkmenistan. The country has a troubling human rights record, and the Embassy raises the issue of human rights and democracy \u201cregularly and at all levels,\u201d says Mustard, who believes that an ongoing dialogue is important. But the U.S. also finds common ground with Turkmenistan, particularly in seeking stability in the region.\n\n\u201cWhen tensions rise and conflict is close to erupting, we often face a choice,\u201d says Mustard. \u201cWe can reduce tensions and reach some mutually acceptable compromise through negotiation, or let things boil over and come to blows.\u00a0 As we have seen from recent examples, wars are expensive, destructive, and cost us the blood of our finest youth. If we have the patience and expertise to negotiate effectively, diplomacy can accomplish a lot.\u201d\n\nSo can cultural and educational programs. The U.S. Embassy reaches out to Turkmen citizens through performances, lectures, movie screenings, and other events that showcase American culture; it also offers an array of educational resources for Turkmen students hoping to study in the U.S.\u00a0 English classes offered by the Embassy fill quickly, with hundreds on the waiting list. \u201cIn our four locations, we get over 11,000 visits monthly from people eager to learn about U.S. culture and education,\u201d says Mustard. The Embassy also collaborates with the Turkmenistan government to preserve historically important Turkmen cultural sites and objects.\n\nThe Ambassador\u2019s three-year appointment in Turkmenistan ends in 2017. What comes next is still unknown. He\u2019s lived in the U.S., USSR, Russia, Turkey, Austria, Mexico, India, and Turkmenistan, and has relished the opportunity to immerse himself in each culture.\n\n\u201cA strong sense of curiosity is an absolute necessity in this career,\u201d he says. \u201cTo be happy working in an embassy, it helps if you love to explore and discover. The Foreign Service isn\u2019t for everyone, but I can\u2019t imagine having done anything else for the last thirty-plus years.\u201d"},{"title":"A tireless advocate for equity","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/a-tireless-advocate-for-equity\/","tags":["alumni","arts-sciences"],"pillars":["public-good","impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"Shirley Malcom, '67, has been a vocal\u00a0advocate for equity in STEM fields, building on her own experiences in the sciences.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, February 2016)\n\n\u201cStranger in a strange land.\u201d That\u2019s how Shirley Malcom describes her first few months as a UW freshman in 1963. Coming from an Alabama high school where every student, teacher, and staff member was African American, it was a shock to be one of three African American women among the four hundred female students in her residence hall. In her science classes, she was the only African American woman.\n\n\u201cIt was hard,\u201d says Malcom (BS, Zoology, 1967), \u201cbut I realized that the isolation was temporary and I needed to take advantage of the opportunities I had.\u201d\n\nHarder yet was discovering that, despite being a star pupil in Alabama, she was woefully underprepared for her UW science courses. After failing two quizzes in a freshman chemistry lab, Malcom knew she needed help but hesitated to reach out to her white professor, convinced that he would deem her incapable of the work and suggest a lower track.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d seen those kind of biases in Alabama,\u201d she says. \u201cThat kind of pre-judging is devastating to students who are bright and eager but haven\u2019t had the background to be able to be competitive.\u201d Malcom did, however, feel comfortable reaching out to a teaching assistant who was African American. He understood her situation, worked with her, and she aced the next quiz.\n\n\u201cIf someone says diversity isn\u2019t important, don\u2019t believe it,\u201d she told UW\u2019s <em>Columns<\/em> magazine, sharing the teaching assistant story years later.\n\nThat freshman experience served as a harbinger of things to come for Malcom, who went on to become a national leader in science education. For more than four decades, she has worked to enhance public science literacy and increase access to education and careers in STEM fields.\u00a0 Her efforts have earned her dozens of major awards, from the UW\u2019s Alumna Summa Laude Dignata Award to the National Academy of Sciences\u2019 Public Welfare Medal. She has co-chaired numerous national committees, including the National Science Board Commission on 21<sup>st<\/sup> Century Education in STEM.\n<div class=\"content\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"content\">\n\nMalcom came to the UW intending to pursue a career in medicine. \u201cI had no idea you could do anything else with science,\u201d she recalls. When she later cooled to the idea of medical school, her faculty adviser (Professor Alan Kohn, now emeritus) suggested a career in academia. \u201cHe did everything to support me in terms of going in a different direction,\u201d says Malcom. \u201cEverybody needs someone who can step up as a guide or mentor, somebody who believes in them.\u201d\n\nMalcom entered a graduate program at UCLA, paused briefly to teach high school science, and eventually earned a PhD in ecology from Penn State University. She joined the faculty at the University of North Carolina-Wilmington, then switched to a job at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) when she married, since\u00a0her husband\u2019s work was in the Washington, D.C. area. She headed AAAS's Office of Opportunities in Science for a decade before\u00a0heading AAAS\u2019s Directorate for Education and Human Resources Programs, a position she has held since the directorate was established in 1989. \u201cI\u2019ve been able to play on a much bigger stage than I would ever have imagined,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just been remarkable.\u201d\n\nOne of Malcom\u2019s early projects at AAAS was an inventory of science programs for minority students. She discovered that most programs focused on male students, with an emphasis on engineering. She shared\u00a0her\u00a0findings\u00a0as co-author of \u201cThe Double Bind: The Price of Being a Minority Woman in Science,\u201d a 1976 landmark report that documented how racism and sexism handicapped women in science. \u201cThere were minorities and there were women, and for those of us who were both, there wasn\u2019t a lot of attention to how our lives and situations might be different,\u201d says Malcom.\n\nMalcom also found that most science programs for minority students were at the college level, overlooking younger students with an interest in science but no clue how to proceed. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t seem that there had been a lot of real strategy and deep thinking that had gone into these programs, to figure out what needed to be done to actually move the needle,\u201d she says. Malcom established youth outreach programs to nurture an early interest in science, offered through churches and other non-academic channels that proved more open to change than public schools.\n\nForty years after Malcom\u2019s landmark report, women and minorities are finding greater success in the sciences, but challenges remain.\u00a0Women receive\u00a0fewer peer nominations for major prizes than their male colleagues and less frequent consideration for leadership positions.\u201cWomen are still not getting their due, though it\u2019s a more nuanced issue now,\u201d says Malcom. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to put your hand on the overt stuff, but this is harder because it\u2019s more subtle. If you complain about it, you sound like you\u2019re whining\u2014and nobody likes a whiner.\u201d\n\nMalcom and her daughter Lindsey, a research associate professor at USC, wrote \u201cThe Double Bind: The Next Generation\u201d as a follow-up to Malcom\u2019s 1976 report. Published in the <em>Harvard Educational Review\u00a0<\/em>in 2011, the study sheds light on issues currently facing minority women in science.\n\n\u201cThrough the years, I\u2019ve had many colleagues say, \u2018If it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u2019\u201d says Malcom. \u201cMy response is, \u2018By whose definition is it not broke?\u2019\u201d\n\nMuch of Malcom\u2019s ongoing work involves promoting policies that counter unconscious bias, recognizing that bias can be insidious and hard to prevent regardless of good intentions.\n\n\u201cWe <em>all<\/em> have biases,\u201d says Malcom, \u201cand there are ways to mitigate the effects of these biases. But first we have to admit that they exist.\u201d\n\n<\/div>"},{"title":"An orchestrated life","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/an-orchestrated-life\/","tags":["alumni","arts-sciences"],"pillars":["innovation","student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Julia Tai, '10, conductor of two orchestras in Seattle, loves \"the challenge of...pulling all the sound together to make something great.\"","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, February 2016)\n\nMusic has always been part of Julia Tai\u2019s life. The Taiwan native began violin lessons at age four and enrolled in an elite music conservatory at age nine. But she never imagined that one day she\u2019d be an orchestra conductor. Now she can\u2019t imagine doing anything else.\n\n\u201cConducting is very different than playing one instrument,\u201d says Tai (DMA, Music, 2010), who conducts <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seattlemodernorchestra.org\/\">Seattle Modern Orchestra <\/a>and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.philharmonianw.org\/\">Philharmonia Northwest<\/a>, two very different orchestras in Seattle. \u201cAs conductor, you are not one piece of the puzzle, you are the one putting all the pieces together.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in Taipei, Tai studied violin, piano, and voice. Then she came to the U.S. to study voice at the University of Southern California (USC) and discovered an affinity for conducting. \u201cAt the time I wasn\u2019t thinking about being a full-on conductor,\u201d says Tai of her foray into conducting. \u201cI just thought it could help me be more versatile.\u201d Before long she was studying with both a choir and orchestra conductor.\n\nTai completed a master\u2019s degree at USC, then moved to Seattle to study with orchestra conductor Peter Er\u00f6s at the University of Washington. She was drawn by Er\u00f6s\u2019s conducting style, which was more about emotional connection to the music than technique. (Er\u00f6s passed away in 2014.) Tai also liked that the UW's conducting program was small, with more hands-on opportunities than other music schools. She received support from several<a href=\"https:\/\/music.washington.edu\/\"> UW School of Music <\/a>endowments, including the Alcor Endowed Scholarship.\n\nTai conducted two operas and numerous symphony concerts at the UW, and served as an assistant conductor to Er\u00f6s, leading rehearsals when he was unavailable. \u201cWith instruments, you practice at home and then perform for people,\u201d says Tai. \u201cBut the conductor\u2019s instrument is the choir or orchestra. If you don\u2019t have opportunities to conduct, you don\u2019t get to practice your instrument and improve. Fortunately, at the UW I got a lot of experience.\u201d\n\nSince graduating, Tai has gained more experience as co-artistic director of Seattle Modern Orchestra, a professional ensemble that she co-founded with composer Jeremy Jolley (MM, 2010) in 2010. While other Seattle ensembles play contemporary music on occasion, Seattle Modern Orchestra fills a unique niche with a singular focus on modern composers.\n\n\u201cContemporary composers are always coming up with new ways of making sound, new ways expressing things,\u201d says Tai. \u201cThey invent notations or new systems to play in. So there\u2019s a lot of new language. Sometimes I get the score and it comes with twelve pages of instruction about what the symbols mean! I feel like I\u2019m always learning something new.\u201d\n\nSoon after co-founding Seattle Modern Orchestra, Tai was named music director of Philharmonia Northwest, a community orchestra whose broad repertoire ranges from Mozart to Debussy to world premieres by local composers. Tai is just the third conductor in the orchestra\u2019s 40-year history.\n\n\u201cPhilharmonia Northwest has a different mindset than Seattle Modern Orchestra,\u201d says Tai. \u201cThe musicians are not paid. They are doing this because they really love music and love playing in an orchestra. They are very skilled, and at least half of them have music degrees, but they have chosen to do something else as a career. Still, they identify themselves as musicians\u2014sometimes more than they identify with their day job.\u201d\n\nAs conductor, Tai sees herself as similar to a coach or project manager. While musicians are responsible for their own performance, she sees the bigger picture. And like any great coach or project manager, she must be part diplomat and part psychologist to achieve the best result. \u201cPeople have personalities and their own opinions, so a big part of it is figuring out how to say something that is effective and at the same time doesn\u2019t diminish their contribution or who they are as a musician,\u201d says Tai. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult at times, because musicians tend to be sensitive.\u201d\n<div class=\"l-region l-region--content-top clearfix\">\n<div class=\"ds-1col node node--news-article view-mode-article_no_sidebar node--article-no-sidebar node--news-article--article-no-sidebar clearfix\">\n<div class=\"\">\n<div class=\"paragraphs-items paragraphs-items-field-news-body paragraphs-items-field-news-body-article-no-sidebar paragraphs-items-article-no-sidebar\">\n\nPhilharmonia Northwest will celebrate its ruby anniversary with a March 19 concert in Benaroya Hall\u2014one of five main concerts the orchestra presents each year. Orchestra members also perform at outreach events in schools, libraries, and other venues. Since taking the helm, Tai has expanded the orchestra\u2019s outreach efforts and fostered creative partnerships, including a recent performance collaboration with Dance Fremont. \u201cAs a conductor, music is only half your job,\u201d says Tai. \u201cIt\u2019s essential that you also do community outreach and education and fund raising. The conductor connects the community and the orchestra.\u201d\n\nTai dreams of conducting a professional symphony orchestra one day, and has served as guest conductor for more than a dozen symphonies, including the Seattle Symphony. But right now her two orchestra jobs\u2014plus\u00a0a new baby\u2014keep her plenty busy.\n\n\u201cI love the challenge of bringing people together and pulling all the sound together to make something great,\u201d says Tai. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a more satisfying job.\u201d\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n&nbsp;"},{"title":"Game designer with a humanist edge","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/game-designer-with-a-humanist-edge\/","tags":["alumni","arts-sciences"],"pillars":["innovation"],"image":"","excerpt":"Matthew Moore, '08, a game designer at Disney Interactive, says that studying the humanities has made him a better designer.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, February 2016)\n\nMatthew Moore is an unlikely video-game designer. As a kid, he played the occasional video game at a friend\u2019s house\u2014his father had banned Nintendo at home\u2014but he was more interested in Drama Club. At the UW, he struggled in an introduction to programming class, feeling more at home in literature courses. So how did Moore land a plum job as a game designer at Disney Interactive?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been incremental,\u201d says Moore (BA, English, 2008). \u201cI\u2019d follow one path and then discover another one. And having an English degree turned out to be a huge plus for me. A giant plus.\u201d\n\nMoore came to the UW at age 26 after earning an associate degree at Shoreline Community College and working as software trainer, salesperson, and volunteer radio DJ. He began taking courses in the English Department and found them to be a good fit.\n\n\u201cI took a lot of classes I really loved,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThere were some interesting deep dives. I studied Shakespeare like everybody else, but I also took crime fiction and a class on comedy in classical English literature. I thought, \u2018I\u2019m at home here. This is where I belong.\u2019\u201d Moore also took a Comparative History of Ideas (CHID) course that explored video games from an academic perspective, looking at such things as how players help shape the narrative. The course would later inform Moore\u2019s own work, but he didn\u2019t know that at the time.\n\nAfter graduation, a friend suggested that Moore\u2014now a fan of video games\u2014become a game tester at Microsoft. Moore worried that his English degree would be a detriment, but instead the hiring manager said, \u201cYou have an English degree and a background in training? You\u2019re hired.\u201d Moore trained new game testers and wrote reports about bugs discovered through their testing. After completing a one-year contract with Microsoft, he moved to ArenaNet as a game tester specializing in copyediting.\u00a0\"I scored well on their editing test,\" says Moore, \"and that was augmented with the perception that, as an English major, I could be counted on to be good with words. I don't shy away from opportunities that are opened because of people's positive associations with my English degree.\"\n\nMoore worked on ArenaNet\u2019s Guild Wars 2, part of a series of successful online role-playing games. Before long he was hiring his own editing staff to manage a tsunami of content. But after working closely with game designers, he realized he wanted <em>their<\/em> job. \u201cI started to get that itch,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI thought, \u2018I want to make this game experience rather than just testing it.'\u201d\u00a0 Told that he could not move into game design without prior experience, Moore spent his free time helping a friend design a mobile game for Windows phones. He was promoted to game designer soon after.\n\nIn 2014 Moore moved to Disney Interactive, where his current project is a mobile game, Marvel Avengers Alliance 2. As a content and narrative designer, he develops game scenarios and creates a guided experience for the \u201cactors\u201d in a scene. \u201cI approach\u00a0game design a little differently than some of my peers,\u201d he told <em>The Seattle Times<\/em> in 2014, explaining that while most designers ask \u00a0\u201cHow do we make fun?,\u201d he instead asks, \u201cWhat are we trying to convey? How will people interact with this? What will it make them think?\u201d Moore traces this thinking back to his CHID course and the many UW English courses that stressed story, character motivation, language, and more.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the idea that if you get an English degree, what can you do with that?\u201d says Moore. \u201cBut having a background in English is useful in a broad variety of careers, including game design, where you need to understand how stories fit together. I think most of us just have too narrow a perception of what an \u2018English job\u2019 is.\u201d\n\nMoore\u2019s love of literature also spawned a recent side project, <em>Bring Your Own Book<\/em>, a low-tech game in the tradition of Apples to Apples. As the name suggests, players arrive armed with a book\u2014anything from <em>Infinite Jest<\/em> to <em>Complete Puppy and Dog Care<\/em>. They take turns drawing prompts from a deck, then everyone races to find a phrase in their book that best satisfies the prompt. \u00a0Books get passed to a neighboring player at certain points, ensuring that all players experience multiple books.\n\nLast year Moore launched a successful Kickstarter campaign to produce a printed version of the game, which should be in stores by April. The game\u2019s rules and prompts are already online for free download at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bringyourownbook.com\/#the-game\">bringyourownbook.com<\/a>.\n\n\u201cNormally we don\u2019t tend to think of a book as an abstract collection of words, but playing this game, you gain an affinity for the text in a new way,\u201d says Moore, sounding every inch an English major. \u201cParticularly for books you don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like opening this treasure trove. You look at the word choice in a way that I don\u2019t think we do very often as casual readers. And then there\u2019s the sharing aspect, seeing what books other people brought and experiencing them.\u201d\n\nIt sounds like the perfect game for a book lover\u2014though Moore insists there is no such thing as the perfect game.\n\n\u201cAs game designers, we are constantly chasing not the perfect game, but the perfect game for right now,\u201d says Moore. \u201cOnce <em>Bring Your Own Book <\/em>comes out, I\u2019ll start looking for the next experience I can give to people. What\u2019s the next undercurrent that needs to be brought to the surface? What\u2019s the thing that I can make that will make people excited and happy to play? That will be my next perfect game.\u201d\n<div class=\"entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-block-full-width-element\"><\/div>"},{"title":"SoCal Huskies give back","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/socal-huskies-give-back\/","tags":["alumni"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"Alumni groups organized service projects for the 2016 MLK Jr. Day of Service.","content":"(UW Alumni Association, February 2016)\n\nhis January, alumni groups in Southern California coordinated volunteer service projects in their communities as part of the UW\u2019s celebration of the Martin Luther King, Jr., Day of Service.\n\nLos Angeles Huskies spent time building community with residents of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.valleyvillage.org\/?gclid=CJOyi_3x3MoCFQdafgodfEAE3g\">Valley Village<\/a>, an organization dedicated to protecting and advancing the rights and interests of people with developmental disabilities.\n\n<strong>Jessica Handy<\/strong>, \u201993, and <strong>Debbie Brand<\/strong>, \u201988, planned the Los Angeles volunteer project with <strong>Jenny Daniels Freese<\/strong>, \u201998, who serves as the Director of Development and Marketing at Valley Village.

Since the show first aired in 1994, Osborne has been vital to the TCM brand and an accustomed presence to families around the world.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/11\/23\/movies\/robert-osborne-is-the-face-of-tcm.html?emc=eta1\">Last year, <em>New York Times <\/em>writer Dan Barry called him<\/a> a \u201cone-of-a-kind cinematic savant, cramming delectable tidbits into brief intros and outros, dissecting films with guests and conducting intimate interviews with stars of a certain age.\u201d Osborne has also been written about in many other publications, like the <em>Washington Post<\/em>, and has interviewed countless film icons, including Lauren Bacall, Shirley MacLaine, Mickey Rooney, and Tony Curtis.\n\nOne might not expect that this prominent figure now residing in New York with his own Hollywood Walk of Fame star is the product of rural Colfax, Washington. He studied journalism at the University of Washington and was a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity.\n\n\u201cHe has become recognized as the leading authority on movies and a familiar face in most American living rooms,\u201d said former fraternity brother Ted Van Dyk (B.A., 1955). \u201cOn top of that, it should be said, he is a good human being who is modest and, unlike many in Hollywood, does not take himself too seriously. He is respected for that in an industry of huge egos and narcissism.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating and serving in the Air Force, Osborne moved to Los Angeles. He had a short stint in acting and then worked for many years as a columnist for <em>The Hollywood Reporter <\/em>covering all aspects of the movie, television, and Broadway worlds.\n\n\u201cHe is a major historian and chronicler of the motion picture industry,\u201d said Osborne\u2019s DU \u2018Little Brother\u2019 Doug Ramsey (B.A., 1956). \u201cAs a primary columnist for <em>The Hollywood Reporter, <\/em>he illustrated public understanding of an important sector of American cultural life and the economy.\u201d\n\nOsborne is also known as the official biographer of Oscar because of the series of books he\u2019s written on the subject of the motion picture industry\u2019s annual Academy Awards \u2013 his latest being \u201c80 Years Of The Oscar,\u201d which was written at the request of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science. Since 2006, he has been the official red carpet greeter at the annual Academy Awards ceremony.\n\nAlthough Robert Keatley (B.A., 1956) has not met Osborne, he said Osborne is deserving of being recognized for his role as a preservationist in helping conserve old films \u201cbecause movies are such an important part of 20<sup>th<\/sup> century American culture.\u201d\n\nKeatley said he has seen TCM broadcast in many places, such as Hong Kong and Bhutan. More locally, Osborne is one of the investors of the Rose Theater in Port Townsend. Since 2005, Osborne has hosted the annual Robert Osborne\u2019s Classic Film Festival in Athens, Georgia.\n\nOn October 1, Osborne joined\u00a0the ranks of former fraternity brothers Van Dyk and Ramsey, and admirer Keatley, as he was inducted into the UW Department of Communication Alumni Hall of Fame.\n\n<em>For more details about the event or to read about other 2015 inductees, <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.com.washington.edu\/2015\/07\/2015-alumni-hall-of-fame-ceremony\/\"><em>click here<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em>"},{"title":"Earthquake authority","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/earthquake-authority\/","tags":["college-of-the-environment","faculty"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"Alongside fellow experts, UW professor John Vidale is working toward making the earthquake-prone Pacific Northwest a safer place.","content":"(UW homepage, February 2016)\n\nIn response to the recent hype surrounding The New Yorker\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/magazine\/2015\/07\/20\/the-really-big-one\">The Really Big One<\/a>\u201d story and a call to action from Washington, D.C., to create an earthquake early warning system, UW professor John Vidale answers some of the Pacific Northwest\u2019s most pressing questions.\n<h3>Q:\u00a0The New Yorker\u2019s July article \u201cThe Really Big One,\u201d which claimed the Pacific Northwest was due for an earthquake that would destroy a sizable portion of the region, sparked a lot of conversation \u2014 and fear. What were your thoughts?<\/h3>\nA: Largely it was a great article, and in a couple of details it was a terrible article. It was full of relevant facts, had some misperceptions, and gave some impressions perhaps it didn\u2019t mean to give, but in the end it helped people realize there are a lot of things we should do now about earthquakes.\n<h3>Q: After reading \u201cThe Really Big One,\u201d it seems people were almost more fearful of a post-earthquake tsunami than an earthquake itself. Should they be?<\/h3>\nA: The article unintentionally said \u201clook out for the tsunamis, everything west of I-5 will be toast,\u201d but really, those sentences shouldn\u2019t be connected. If a magnitude 9 earthquake happens on the coast, Pacific coastal communities will be at risk of damage. However, if any of those waves travel through the Strait of Juan de Fuca to Puget Sound, they would take hours to reach us, and we\u2019d see them coming. Plus, they would be much smaller and weaker after traveling so far. So no, Seattle doesn\u2019t have to worry about tsunamis from a magnitude 9.\n<h3>Q: Tell us about your work with the <a href=\"https:\/\/hazards.uw.edu\/geology\/m9\/\">M9 Project<\/a>, and how it\u2019s changing the way we prepare ourselves for the next big one.<\/h3>\nA: <a href=\"https:\/\/hazards.uw.edu\/geology\/m9\/\">The M9 Project<\/a> looks at what the effect of a magnitude 9 earthquake would be on the Pacific Northwest, and it drives us to collaborate across disciplines at the UW. We\u2019re working together to make sure that all of our emergency response systems are prepared and ready to go in the event of a quake, and that we\u2019re being proactive in retrofitting the city for the next big one. The project brings together seismologists, scientists who know water waves, engineers who look at the buildings, and engineers specializing in landslides and liquefaction. Then we loop in state agencies, from emergency management to natural resources to public education. The M9 Project lets us work across campus and the city, and we\u2019re making connections we\u2019ll keep for the long term.\n<h3>Q: One of the goals of a number of the projects you\u2019re working on is an early earthquake warning system. Tell us about that.<\/h3>\nA: We\u2019re developing the capability to recognize the earthquake before the shaking arrives, which could be anywhere from nothing to a couple of minutes. An earthquake early warning system would give people crucial seconds to minutes to take action that could protect life and property from strong shaking. If the earthquake is right under our feet, we can\u2019t warn people because as soon as we notice it, we get rocked. But if it\u2019s a big earthquake on the coast or in California, it would take a few minutes for the crack to spread and rupture near us, giving us two, three or four minutes warning. The idea is that the warning system should tell you that in X amount of time, you\u2019re going to get Y amount of shaking.\n<h3>Q: What does the earthquake early warning system look like tangibly?<\/h3>\nA: Cell phones, ideally \u2014 kind of like an Amber Alert, where your phone makes a characteristic tone and everyone knows that means there\u2019s an earthquake. The trouble is that Amber Alerts take minutes to go through the system, so there are people working in California to try to get the FCC to approve and require communications that would work within seconds in the event of an earthquake. There\u2019s also a request to make the signal automatic \u2014 right now it has to be manually activated by people. There are also sirens, broadcasts through TV stations, radio, even Sound Transit. Additionally, we\u2019re working with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/uwem\/\">UW Emergency<\/a> to link it to the broadcast system around campus.\n<h3>Q: Will you ever be able to predict an earthquake?<\/h3>\nA: The best we can hope for is an indication of times when we\u2019re at increased risk. For example, before the Japan magnitude 9 earthquake that killed 20,000 people in 2011, there were two days of very strange activity right where that earthquake started \u2014 a magnitude 7 earthquake, followed by something we call \u201cslow earthquakes,\u201d which are sort of like a regular earthquake only a thousand times slower. Now the Japanese scientists know what to look for and put out 150 stations on the seafloor because they want to see the slow earthquakes unfolding next time.\n<h3>Q: What hurdles remain in making the early warning system available?<\/h3>\nA: We have the technology now to provide accurate alerts for earthquakes up to about a magnitude 7, but the system must be fully funded to operate. Beyond that, additional funding investments are needed to provide accurate alerts for earthquakes that reach magnitude 9 or higher, and to deploy a network of underwater warning sensors off the Pacific coast that would better detect and measure offshore seismic activity, which also has the potential to result in dangerous tsunamis. These large earthquakes are a very real threat along the West coast and would begin offshore, as did the 2011 quake in Japan.\n<h2>More about John Vidale<\/h2>\n<h3>John Vidale<\/h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Professor, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ess.washington.edu\/\">Department of Earth and Space Sciences<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li>Director, <a href=\"http:\/\/pnsn.org\/\">Pacific Northwest Seismic Network<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li>Washington state seismologist<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nVidale\u2019s been interested in the earth and its inner workings since he was a young boy, thanks to his mother, a geologist.

This same dashboard hangs in all the West Campus dorms, something one student group is very proud of.\n\nThe dashboards allow students to see how their building is performing compared to the others, which encourages conservation. The displays are one reminder of a larger sustainability culture in the residence halls, a culture Students Expressing Environmental Dedication (SEED) is working to encourage.\n\n\u201cWe want to push students to make changes in their lives,\u201d said Feben Gebremichael, Director of SEED, a UW student organization focused on promoting sustainability in residence halls and the campus community. \"Our mission is to create an open environment to talk about sustainable issues and ways to live more green with anyone who wants to learn.\u201d\n\nSEED was born out of a vision to place recycling bins on every floor of the residence halls. In January of 2006, that vision became a reality. Since then, the organization has been working with Housing and Food Services (HFS) to promote additional green sustainable programs. Their current project: increase waste diversion and composting.\n\nSEED is working on creating a variety of posters to illustrate how and why to compost, including 3-D signs showing physical items grouped according to compost, recycling, and trash. Currently, all HFS-run dining areas, residence hall lobbies and some individual halls contain compost bins. The goal is to add compost bins to the floor level lounges in Hagget and McMahon as well.\n\n\u201cWe purchase bins, so we can distribute them to students for free,\u201d said Gebremichael. \u201cWe try to encourage students to make changes in their lives without making them feel too overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nThe encouragement has paid off. Just this past April, the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/green.uw.edu\/blog\/2015-04\/uw-recognized-recyclemania-tournament\">UW\u2019s Seattle campus earned a spot on the list of top 20 schools in RecycleMania<\/a>, a national collegiate waste diversion tournament. UW finished 17<sup>th<\/sup>\u00a0with a recycling rate of nearly 63 percent and came in on top among all Pac-12 schools in total waste diversion, which includes recycling and composting.\n\n\"Waste diversion is a huge project we have been tackling,\" said Gebremichael. \"We try to push students to have better habits and use their resources.\"\n\nCompetition can help students work to change habits. In addition to RecycleMania, SEED also helps organize a \"One Thing Challenge\" each year, a competition between UW and Washington State University to see which school has the greenest campus. Each campus has\u00a0students pledge to change one thing in their normal routine to be more environmentally friendly. This year when UW won, participating students received coupons to Rick\u2019s Caf\u00e9.\n\n\u201cIt was very invigorating,\" said Gebremichael. \"People didn\u2019t even need the ice cream coupon. Once we won a competition against WSU, everyone was all fired up.\u201d\n\nMembers of SEED try to come up with other engaging activities throughout the year to promote the benefits of leading sustainable lives and helping the environment.\n\nJust this past January, the student organization removed invasive species, such as blackberries and English ivy in Seattle's Cheasty Greenspace in honor of the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/carlson\/events\/martin-luther-king-jr-day-of-service\/\">MLK Jr. Day of Service<\/a>, an event that places nearly two thousand volunteers in day-long service projects throughout King County.\n\n\u201cFor me, it hits home because I am a first generation American,\u201d said Gebremichael. \u201cMy family grew up in Africa where it is more rural and agricultural. When my family talks about home, they say the air they breathe there is cleaner. It made me think about what I can do to make the environment here cleaner.\u201d\n\nThe group wants to unite students from all campus residence halls for sustainability. SEED members participate in \u201cSustainable Sundays,\u201d a day where students from residence halls join in on activities ranging from renting canoes to enjoying a meal at a sustainable restaurant. Students in all residences across West and North campus are encouraged to participate, as well as attend the group's weekly meetings.\n\n\u201cWe welcome students to give a presentation on something they are passionate about during the weekly meetings,\u201d said Gebremichael. \u201cIn essence, starting a discussion on issues like sustainable farming, clean energy, and sustainable agriculture.

It\u2019s hidden in a grove of trees just east of the <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/uwbg\/visit\/cuh.php\">UW Center for Urban Horticulture<\/a>, remaining a fairly unknown public area to this day.\n\nTwo UW students hope to change that. Back in 2013, Carolyn Foster and Tyler Licata started the <a href=\"http:\/\/yeslerswamp.weebly.com\/\">Yesler Swamp Project<\/a> in an effort to increase awareness for critical wildlife habitats along Lake Washington\u2019s shoreline and make the swamp more accessible to the public.\n\nTheir hard work is paying off. Since the project first began, over 500 volunteers, ranging from UW students to neighboring communities, have come together to restore and protect the wetland ecosystem. What was once overgrown and impossible to walk through, is now full of native plants and a clean, inviting landscape.\n\nBut, the restoration project is far from over. Every month, Foster and Licata host work parties to maintain the swamp\u2019s landscape\u00a0and plant new shrubs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really trying to use Yesler Swamp as not only a place of teaching people how to complete restoration projects, but also to encourage them how to be stewards of their local land,\u201d said Foster. \u201cWe want this to be a really nice public amenity that people can enjoy.\u201d\n\nThe process of restoring isn\u2019t without its challenges. Volunteers have removed hundreds of invasive plants, including Himalayan blackberry, English ivy, and morning glory to make room for native ones. Invasive species, when in excessive amounts, can take over an ecosystem and stifle native vegetation from thriving.\n\n\u201cThe thing about restoration is that you always have to keep working to preserve the land,\u201d said Foster. \u201cInvasive species keep coming back because their root systems are very intricate, so when you pull things off the surface there are still a lot of things going on underneath the soil.\u201d\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/yeslerswamp.org\/\">Friends of Yesler<\/a>, a nonprofit group dedicated to preserving the swamp, purchases a majority of the plants for the student-led restoration project. Thanks to them, a boardwalk surrounds the swamp and provides easy access for bird watchers and animal lovers to come and actively engage with the local environment.\n\nThe student group only hopes to increase that engagement in coming months. As of spring 2016, there will be a fully constructed bird blind, providing a space for the greater Seattle community to view wildlife. The bird blind will include an 8 ft. by 16 ft. platform with a partially covered roof, bench, and a stand for binoculars. For easy access to the bird blind, the boardwalk that surrounds Yesler Swamp will connect to the platform.\n\nTo aid with the process, the student-led group received $12,000 from the <a href=\"https:\/\/csf.uw.edu\/\">Campus Sustainability Fund<\/a> to kick-start the project. The additional $53,000 will be released once Foster and Licata can secure a building permit to construct a bird blind in the area.\n\n\"We try to be stewards of Yesler Swamp,\u201d said Foster. \u201cWe want this to be a community landmark where people have a sense of ownership. It\u2019s not only a place for wildlife, but also a place where you can sit and enjoy the view.\u201d\n<div><\/div>\n&nbsp;"},{"title":"UW group encourages restoration projects on campus","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/uw-group-encourages-restoration-projects-on-campus\/","tags":["college-of-the-environment","graduate-student"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"UW\u2019s Society for Ecology Restoration has been working to restore areas on campus by increasing native species biodiversity and creating open spaces for students to engage with the natural world, just steps from their residence halls.","content":"(UW Sustainability, July 2015)\n\nYou may not have noticed, but as you walk around the UW campus more of those plants and flowers at your feet are species native to Puget Sound.\n\nThat\u2019s because UW\u2019s Society for Ecology Restoration student guild (SER-UW) native plant nursery has been working to restore areas on campus by increasing native species biodiversity and creating open spaces for students to engage with the natural world just steps from their residence halls.\n\nSince 2013, SER has been removing interloper invasive species in Whitman Walk, a north campus site near McCarty Hall and Kincaid Ravine, an urban forest in the northeast corner of campus, to make space for native plants.\u00a0Now, the student group manages over 2,000 containerized plants, many of which have been placed in these two restoration areas.\n\nThe plant nursery is part of the <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/uwbg\/visit\/cuh.php\">Center for Urban Horticulture<\/a>, a 16-acre landscaped site housing the <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/uwbg\/gardens\/wpa.shtml\">UW Botanic Gardens<\/a>, an outdoor laboratory for UW research, and the 74-acre <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/uwbg\/research\/ubna.shtml\">Union Bay Natural Area<\/a>, which is home to more than 200 bird species and wildlife.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in an amazing region of the country that\u2019s doing awesome work for restoration ecology,\u201d said Anna Carragee, one of the plant nursery managers. \u201cAs a student group, we\u2019re really trying to address habitat restoration and different ecosystems in general.\u201d\n\nTo aid with the process, the student-led organization received over $54,000 from the <a href=\"https:\/\/csf.uw.edu\/project\/fp\/560\">Campus Sustainability Fund<\/a> to increase plant production and quality of care for plants.

This year, a total of <a href=\"http:\/\/environmentalalternativespringbreak.weebly.com\/easb-2015.html\">16 students participated<\/a>. Students were divided into groups of four, each traveling to Castle Rock, La Push, Bridgeport, or Brewster.\n\nHaller and three other UW students <a href=\"http:\/\/environmentalalternativespringbreak.weebly.com\/brewster\">traveled to Brewster<\/a> to teach an ecology-centered lesson at a local middle school. Each of the five school days was dedicated to a science-related topic, ranging from watershed biology and fish, to forest ecosystems and the reintroduction of wolves into the environment.\n\n\"We took the community\u2019s assets into consideration and focused on real-world application,\" said Meili Powell, Environmental Spring Break coordinator and one of the UW student teachers. \"We wanted the lessons to be as realistic as possible.\"\n\nBrewster rests on the Columbia River, between the Chief Joseph and Azwell Dams. Residents use the dams, which usually have the highest concentration of fish in the area, to catch bass, salmon, and trout.\n\nTo demonstrate the harmful effects of overfishing, Haller had each student create a model of a watershed and \"stock\" them with candy fish. The students were then asked to catch fish from their self-created watersheds. Students had a tendency to catch as many fish as possible, which quickly depleted the fish stock and recreated the real-life problem of overfishing.\n\n\"We had students brainstorm ways of making fishing more sustainable and taught them about local fishing regulations, licenses, and catch limits,\" said Haller. \"Ultimately, we stressed protecting the environment and its resources.\"\n\nThe sixth graders were encouraged to keep science journals to jot down important takeaways from each of the lessons. On the last day, the UW group came up with trivia questions to quiz students on what they had learned.\n\n\"The first day they were kind of shy,\" said Haller. \"But, by the end of the week, they were all jumping up and down, raising their hands to answer questions.

A majority of kids in the town don\u2019t expect to go to college, said Haller, who feels the UW students were also able to show the classes how rewarding college can be.\n\nIn addition to teaching during the day, the Environmental Alternative Spring Break group conducted college outreach at a local high school and visited the first Boys and Girls Club in Brewster.\n\n\"It\u2019s amazing how we could build such a deep connection with a class and a group of students in such a short amount of time,\" said Powell. \"On the car ride home, I got an email from one of the teachers saying how valuable us being there was. It gave her new ideas of how to deepen the way she presents environmental education to her students.\""},{"title":"UW Conservation Canines are saving endangered species","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/uw-conservation-canines-are-saving-endangered-species\/","tags":["arts-sciences","faculty","global"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"From orcas to caterpillars, a few dogs at the University of Washington\u00a0are used by conservation biologists to study endangered animal species all over the world\u00a0\u2014 by looking for what they've left behind.","content":"(UW Sustainability, October 2015)\n\nFrom orcas to caterpillars, a few dogs at the University of Washington can find nearly any animal you'd want to find - by looking for what they've left behind.\n\nSince 1997, the <a href=\"http:\/\/conservationbiology.uw.edu\/conservation-canines\/\">UW Conservation Canines program<\/a> has been training former strays - shelter dogs too aggressive or feisty to be adopted - to protect endangered species. Their tactic: letting them traverse plains, climb mountains, trek through snow, and clamber over rocks and fallen trees all with the expectation of reward: a rubber ball to play with.\n\n\"The dogs all have such unique personalities,\" said Heath Smith, the Center's program coordinator. 'Watching them learn and get excited about the work that their doing is fantastic. We\u2019re basically taking animals that have run out of chances and giving them a second chance to help save a population.\"\n\nThe program\u2019s team of handlers works with a motley crew of 17 misfits-turned-dog detectives, some who are as old as 12, to track animal feces. Scat (poop) samples are then taken to Johnson Hall to be tested.\n\nFrom a scat sample, researchers are able to identify what types of pressures certain populations are facing, including toxicity levels, diseases, and dietary factors. It also helps researchers make population estimates in any given area or discern which environmental factors are having negative impacts on animals.\n\n\"Our focus is educating people on what\u2019s having a harmful effect on populations and working to reduce it,\" said Smith. \"We publish papers for the research community to hopefully spark action.\"\n\nThe conservation team and their dog detectives have been all over the world \u2013 traveling as far as Africa to working as close as the Puget Sound. The dogs have located the droppings of over 40 different species, ranging from tigers, wolves, and bears to jaguars, spotted owls, and caribou. When they're not searching in the wild, the dogs are housed at the training facility at the Pack Forest in\u00a0Eatonville.\n\n\"Our work offers a nonbiased and noninvasive approach,\" said Smith. \"It\u2019s noninvasive in that we don\u2019t have to trap or tag the animal. It\u2019s nonbiased because we\u2019re finding their spore sample that they left in the environment.\"\n\nIt\u2019s a highly popular approach, said Smith. The dogs are able to cover a huge amount of area in a short period of time and collect massive amounts of data in the process.\n\nThis data has been helpful to researchers both at home and abroad. The Canines Conservation program has been working for a wide variety of people \u2013 whether its biologists with state or federal wildlife departments or scientists as far as Africa, Turkey, Portugal, or France.\n\nBut the conservation team hasn\u2019t forgotten about what\u2019s happening in Washington\u2019s own backyard. Studies surrounding spotted owls, killer whales, and wolves are also on the team\u2019s radar.\n\n\"Those are some of the environmental issues closer to home,\" said Smith. \"We see how the dogs really benefit from collecting a huge amount of data so quickly to help us answer questions about certain species. It\u2019s all very rewarding.\""},{"title":"Photos may be the key to saving the endangered Gal\u00e1pagos penguins","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/photos-may-be-the-key-to-saving-the-endangered-galapagos-penguins\/","tags":["arts-sciences","faculty","global"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"Dr. P. Dee Boersma is exploring whether a tourist, a camera and a good eye may just be the trick to help save the endangered Galapagos penguins.","content":"(UW Sustainability, November 2015)\n\nA tourist, a camera and a good eye may just be the trick to saving the endangered Galapagos penguins.\n\nTourists and the photographs they take can provide valuable information about the health of the Galapagos penguins and their surrounding environment. From a single shot, UW researchers can <a href=\"http:\/\/www.igalapagos.org\/\">determine whether a penguin is breeding, molting or migrating, as well as the bird's age, health status and other information<\/a>.\n\n\"It\u2019s really expensive to go to the Galapagos, let alone where the penguins are,\" said <a href=\"http:\/\/www.igalapagos.org\/dr-dee-boersma\/\">Dr. Dee Boersma<\/a>, one of the project's lead investigators. \"Tourist boats go there every week, so we rely on their assistance to help us learn more about the penguins. We\u2019re just trying to make the world an easier place for penguins to survive.\"\n\nBoersma has dedicated her life to preserving the penguin population. So much that she started the UW's\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.penguinstudies.org\/\">Center for Penguins as Ocean Sentinels<\/a> to help protect their environment and inspire others to take action in sustaining our natural world along the way. Her work has gained national attention - this August, she was <a href=\"http:\/\/news.nationalgeographic.com\/2015\/08\/150818-indianapolis-prize-nominees-animal-conservation-awards\/\">nominated for the 2016 Indianapolis Prize, the top award for animal conservation<\/a>, in recognition for her penguin work.\n\nCurrently, Boersma focuses on preserving the Galapagos and Magellenic penguins. In addition to work in the field, undergraduate and graduate students are busy analyzing a wealth of data in the Center's lab on campus.\u00a0Projects range from creating maps to pinpoint the penguins' migration patterns and time traveled, to writing research papers on how to build a marine protected area.\n\nBoersma and her lab understand the necessity of taking steps to make their everyday work as environmentally friendly as possible whether they're in the field studying penguins or at their lab on campus analyzing data. The Penguin Sentinels lab in Kincaid Hall is certified Gold by the UW's Green Laboratory Certification Program. The lab focuses on finding trends from collected data, organizing research trips, or brainstorming ways of limiting negative human impact on penguins' habitats.\n\n\"Humans are putting increased pressure on penguins and most other wildlife on this planet,\u201d said Boersma. \"The Galapagos penguins have never gotten back to the numbers they once were in the 1970s. We counted over 2,000 then. Now, there are less than 1,000.\"\n\nA main reason is overfishing. Penguins rely on forage fish (squid, anchovies, and crustaceans), and unfortunately, so do marine fisheries. Forage fish produce a sizable share of the global wild marine fish catch. Boersma says at least one third of forage fish should be left for penguins and other marine mammals to eat, but many end up being processed as food for chickens, pets, and fish farms.\n\n\"Is it worth it to suck those fish out to feed salmon, pigs, or chickens?\" said Boersma. \"I don\u2019t think so. Penguins are really interesting and enrich our lives. We have to start looking at how we can balance and preserve our resources more effectively.\"\n\nIn an effort to stop overfishing, Boersma and her lab are trying to create a marine protected area in the Galapagos Islands, which will help the area penguin population. The more food there is, the more likely it is for the penguins to breed. Almost all species of penguins drop their feathers once a year, except the Galapagos who molt twice in a year. To prepare for molting, penguins can gain about a third of their body weight, sometimes even half. Then that added body weight is used as energy to grow new feathers.\n\nAfter the molting process is complete, the penguins try to breed. Most females will lay two eggs, but if there\u2019s no food the birds will desert their nest in an effort to keep themselves alive.\n\nTo help with the breeding process, Boersma led an effort to build artificial nests for the penguins to use and she travels to the Galapagos Islands twice a year to see if the penguins are using them for breeding. So far 120 nests have been built and nine penguins have successfully bred there. When Boersma isn't able to be on location doing fieldwork, she relies on pictures to tell her what the penguins are doing.\n\n\u201cHaving pictures is like having eyes on the ground,\u201d Boersma said. \u201cWe can piece what the penguins are doing in different parts of the island. That\u2019s why having eyes and ears in the area are so important for science because we can learn things that we normally wouldn't.\"\n\nShe added, \u201cOverall, I think penguins are a good way to show people what\u2019s going to happen to earth if we don\u2019t start taking better care of it. We can continue to ignore all of these signals, but the wildlife is already telling us.\u201d"},{"title":"UW students return from Paris climate talks, advocate for stronger youth voice","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/uw-students-return-from-paris-climate-talks-advocate-for-stronger-youth-voice\/","tags":["arts-sciences","college-of-the-environment","global","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good","student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Empowered by their experience abroad, a group of College of the Environment students are working toward more youth engagement in global conversations about the planet.","content":"(College of the Environment, January 2016)\n\nStudents from the College of the Environment lived\u00a0a dream in Paris\u2014they took part in a global conversation about how to combat climate change alongside leaders and decision-makers, shared their perspectives as youth representing the Pacific Northwest, and expanded their understanding of the planet\u2019s interconnected landscapes through forged connections.\n\nNow back in Seattle after attending the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.landscapes.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Global Landscapes Forum<\/a> (GLF), part of the <a href=\"https:\/\/environment.uw.edu\/news\/2015\/11\/countdown-to-the-2015-paris-climate-conference\/\">Paris climate talks<\/a>, the\u00a0group of University of Washington students is united in their call for greater youth perspective in discussions about the future of our planet.\n\n\u201c2015 was a huge year for international climate legislation. It was important for youth to be there and for our voice to be heard,\u201d senior Salina Abraham said. \u201cTo be present was\u00a0powerful.\u201d\n\nGLF attendees, 3,200 people from 135 countries, were committed to looking at the complexities of climate change and its impacts on landscapes together.\u00a0Abraham, along with Natalie Gray and Rachel Yonemura from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sefs.washington.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">School of Environmental and Forest Sciences<\/a> and Lars Olson from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biology.washington.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Department of Biology<\/a> were able to attend through their involvement in UW\u2019s chapter of the International Forestry Students\u2019 Association (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ifsa.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IFSA<\/a>).\n\nThe students learned from leaders in forestry, agriculture, water, energy, law, and finance who addressed\u00a0everything from resilient landscapes to green growth compacts and watched\u00a0as innovative products and initiatives aimed at tackling real-world issues were launched, all while sitting at the center of a global conversation. Representing four of 50 IFSA members chosen to attend the GLF, the UW students also networked with their peers\u2014now friends and likely future collaborators\u2014from Belgium, the Philippines, and beyond.\n\n\u201cThe youth are everything.

At the Veterans Health Administration, a new generation of leaders is reforming case management and applying prevention science to improve outcomes for veterans and their families.\n\nMichael Kilmer, \u201901, \u201904, is at the forefront of this transformation. As the chief advisor on care management and social work services at the Department of Veterans Affairs, Kilmer oversees 11,000 social workers and six innovative programs that take integrated, patient-focused care to a new level. Key elements include team-based transition management for returning veterans, support and training for family caregivers, designated patient advocates, and domestic violence screening, prevention and intervention.\n\nA native of Grays Harbor County, Washington, Kilmer enrolled in the UW School of Social Work in 2002 after 15 years in the U.S. Coast Guard and completing his bachelor\u2019s degree from UW Tacoma\u2019s Interdisciplinary Arts &amp; Sciences program. His departure from the military was not voluntary\u2014he was one of 14,000 service members forced out under the Department of Defense\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy on sexual orientation between 1994 and 2010.\n\nAfter his discharge, Kilmer volunteered with the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, lobbying legislators, raising funds and counseling other veterans facing expulsion because of their sexual orientation. He earned his MSW in clinical and contextual social work methods in 2004.\n\nKilmer put his training in cross-disciplinary social work to immediate use at the VA San Diego Healthcare System, where he created a nationally recognized care management program for post-9\/11 combat veterans. He then oversaw multidisciplinary care management for the VA across southern California and southern Nevada, before being promoted to VA headquarters in Washington, D.C., in 2013.\n\nOne of the newest programs under Kilmer\u2019s leadership is the Domestic Violence\/Intimate Partner Violence Assistance Program. Research shows that post-traumatic stress disorder is associated with higher rates of intimate partner violence, and that about one in three female veterans has experienced domestic violence at some point in her life.\n\nThe program, which shifts from a culture of \u201cshaming and blaming\u201d to trauma-informed care, focuses on educating primary care providers and community members about intimate partner violence. Eventually, 150 VA facilities will have intimate partner violence coordinators on staff. \u201cSince veterans return to their communities after their tours of duty, it\u2019s critical to have community resources and advocates available to make this effort succeed,\u201d says Kilmer.\n\nAnother rapidly growing program led by Kilmer, the VA Caregiver Support Program, offers assistance to family members who are caring for injured or disabled veterans. The support includes self-care classes, respite care, and financial assistance to about 20,000 families, with 450 more signing up each month.\n\nLike many of his fellow MSW graduates, Kilmer was attuned to those in need from a young age. In grade school, he worked with kids with special needs; in high school, he volunteered at a teen crisis line. He credits the Coast Guard with satisfying his calling to help others while building his self-confidence.\n\nKilmer now looks forward to finding ways for the VA and the School of Social Work to collaborate. \u201cMy goal is to strengthen relationships with proven sources of research and innovation, such as the University of Washington,\u201d says Kilmer. \u201cWhat I learned as a student, and what I bring to my day-to-day work with veterans, is that service must be rooted in science to create change that matters.\u201d\n\nIn recognition of his transformative work, Kilmer was the first recipient of the UW School of Social Work\u2019s Early Career Achievement Award in 2014.\n\n&nbsp;"},{"title":"Dedicated to diversity","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/dedicated-to-diversity\/","tags":["college-of-education","faculty","bothell"],"pillars":["public-good","impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"James and Cherry Banks have shared a life in academia,\u00a0co-authoring five books and dozens of articles on the subject.

Cherry McGee was searching for a copy of the Kerner Report, a recently published government study. Her friend suggested that a fellow named James Banks might have it. After all, James had his own personal library in 242 Owen Hall. If anybody had a copy, the friend said, it would be him.\n\nThe Kerner Report, the product of an 11-member commission on civil disorder, analyzed a series of race riots that had swept the nation in 1967. \u201cOur nation is moving toward two societies,\u201d the commission wrote in their report, \u201cone black, one white \u2014 separate and unequal.\u201d\n\nSure enough, James had it on his bookshelf. That was no coincidence: The former 5th-grade teacher had enrolled in graduate school to research the budding field of black studies. He lent the book to Cherry, a grad student hoping to cite it in a paper, then asked her on a date shortly after. Nine months later they were James and Cherry Banks.\n\nIn the half-century since, the couple has been at the forefront of multicultural education in America, co-authoring five books and dozens of articles on the subject. James founded the <a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/cme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UW Center for Multicultural Education<\/a> in 1992, while Cherry, a faculty associate at the center, helped launch UW Bothell\u2019s education program the same year.\n\n***\n\nThey arrived in Washington in 1969, when James became the first black professor in the UW College of Education.\n\n\u201cEverybody of color during that era was the first,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThis was the era when predominantly white institutions began to hire a noticeable number of people of color.\u201d\n\nFor James, who grew up in the segregated South, academic research and personal experience had always been intertwined. The second-grader who walked five miles to an all-black school was now integrating higher education in the Pacific Northwest. \u201cI was pursuing my own journey and my own dream,\u201d he said, \u201ctrying to figure out what had happened in my experience and the experience of my people.\u201d\n\nHis first book, <em>March Toward Freedom: A History of Black Americans<\/em>, fell into the field of black studies. Through the years, that field expanded to be known as ethnic studies, then to multiethnic education, and eventually to multicultural education.\n\nJames, now referred to as the Father of Multicultural Education, had a hand on the wheel at each turn, and the road wasn\u2019t always paved smoothly \u2014\u00a0or paved at all. At first, he struggled to find a publisher for his foundational 1975 book <em>Teaching Strategies for Ethnic Studies<\/em>, which is now in its 8th edition. \u201cThey didn\u2019t think there was a need or an audience,\u201d Cherry recalled.\n\nTwenty years later, when the couple published their <em>Handbook of Research on Multicultural Education<\/em> in 1995, the field was still fragile. \u201cThat book put the knowledge base out there,\u201d Cherry said, and it defined what the underpinning research would be. By the time they released a second edition, in 2004, multicultural education had established itself in schools and universities across America.\n\nAnd yet, challenges endure. Some states, notably Arizona, have resisted including other cultures in their curriculum, and K-12 textbooks often neglect narratives of people of color. There also remains a stubborn resistance to the basic ideals of multiculturalism; James suggested the presidential election as one reminder of that.\n\n\u201cThere are some candidates talking about, \u2018Let\u2019s get America back,'\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t go backward. We have to think about how we can reinvent and reconceptualize America for the future.\u201d\n\nAs the U.S. Supreme Court deliberates<em> Fisher v. University of Texas<\/em>, a case that could dismantle affirmative action in higher education, there is renewed debate over the value of diversity in the classroom.\n\n\u201cWhat unique perspective does a minority student bring to a physics class?\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts asked during oral arguments in December. For James and Cherry, the answer is straightforward: learning alongside classmates from other backgrounds is the blueprint for a good education \u2014\u00a0regardless of the subject.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t educate students within a diverse environment, we don\u2019t help them develop the skills and knowledge and confidence they need to function in a society that\u2019s very diverse,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s really an imperative for educating citizens.\u201d\n\n***\n\nCherry teaches future K-12 educators in UW Bothell\u2019s School of Educational Studies. She founded the program with two others, Jane VanGalen and Pat Phelan, in 1992. They drafted guidelines from scratch, penned new syllabi every quarter \u2014\u00a0built the plane as they flew it, they would joke.\n\n\u201cWe were doing something very new,\u201d she said. \u201cWe took advantage of all of the things that were happening across the country, and thought about how we could put those things to work in a new program.\u201d\n\nShe was the first African-American faculty member at UW Bothell \u2014\u00a0a parallel to her husband\u2019s arrival to academia 23 years earlier. Over time, UW Bothell\u2019s faculty became more diverse, and James is now joined by other black lecturers and professors in the College of Education.\n\nStill, the UW has room to improve with respect to diversity of both students and faculty. African Americans, who make up 8% of the Seattle population,\u00a0account for only 3.5% of UW Seattle students and 1.7% of faculty members (including only 1.4% of new hires in 2015).\n\n\u201cWhen we see those kinds of statistics, it should be a statement that allows for people to step back and think about what is happening in our society,\u201d Cherry said. \u201cBecause we\u2019re clearly missing a lot of great potential out there.\u201d\n\nJames agreed: \u201cIt\u2019s not enough, and I think our president realizes that,\u201d he said of Ana Marie Cauce, who serves as a faculty member at the Center for Multicultural Education. \u201cBut it\u2019s also at the dean level, the faculty level. You need many different players to make it happen.\u201d\n\nCherry thinks the Bothell campus can provide insight and leadership on the issue. The smaller, more flexible learning environment has become one of the most ethnically diverse campuses in the nation.\n\nBut diversity in higher ed isn\u2019t something colleges and universities can fix by themselves. Many students of color stumble in K-12 classrooms, Cherry noted, despite research that shows high levels of enthusiasm when they enter grade school.\n\n\u201cSomething happens as they stay in school \u2014 that enthusiasm gets tamped down,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to look at what\u2019s happening in communities that limit opportunities for students in K-12.\u201d\n\nCherry exudes optimism while talking about these challenges, no matter how bleak they may seem. She credits that positivity to her grandmother, a lifelong member of the NAACP who let her \u00ad\u00adsit in on meetings as a child.\n\n\u201cI come from a background where I see possibilities where perhaps others don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI tend to think about how far we\u2019ve come \u2014 not to say we\u2019ve come far enough \u2014 but I look at that journey and I think there\u2019s hope, that there\u2019s possibility for going further.\u201d\n\n***\n\nWhen asked what it\u2019s been like to conduct his life\u2019s work with his life partner, James\u2019s answer was \u2014 unsurprisingly \u2014 an academic one: he cited John Hope Franklin, a trailblazing black historian who researched, among a lifetime of other topics, married scholars who worked together.\n\n\u201cHe found their work was enriched and deepened by the exchange and the insight,\u201d James said. \u201cI think this reflects Cherry and I. It makes your work more potent and more powerful.\u201d\n\nCherry also pointed to researchers: Kenneth and Mamie Clark, the married African-American psychologists whose famous<a href=\"http:\/\/www.naacpldf.org\/brown-at-60-the-doll-test\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">doll test<\/a> illustrated the toll that segregation took on black children in the South.\n\n\u201cThat was my image of a good marriage and a good life,\u201d Cherry said about the Clarks, whose research ended up in the Supreme Court case <em>Brown v. Board of Education<\/em>. \u201cThese two people, both committed to similar values, had been able to make a significant contribution to society through their scholarship.\u201d\n\n<em>James has an A.A. from Chicago City College, a B.E. from Chicago Teachers College (now Chicago State University), and an M.A. and Ph.D. from Michigan State University.

And the next day, they\u2019ll enter a simulation lab to help deliver a virtual \u201cbaby.\u201d For one week, they have the opportunity to learn about the world of nursing \u2014 a profession they hope to one day join.\n\nEach summer, thanks to generous gifts that support the program, about two dozen high school sophomores and juniors \u2014 predominantly from low-income or underrepresented backgrounds \u2014 attend the <a href=\"https:\/\/nursing.uw.edu\/about\/uw-nurse-camp\">School of Nursing\u2019s Nurse Camp<\/a> free of charge. More than a hands-on exploration of nursing careers, the program changes students\u2019 lives.\n\n\u201cMany of these campers haven\u2019t heard, \u2018You have what it takes to get into school,\u2019\u201d explains Karissa Sanchez, a former participant. While underrepresented minority groups make up more than one-third of the U.S. population, less than 20 percent of nurses hail from minority backgrounds \u2014 a statistic the camp is working to change. \u201cThe UW has really made a conscious effort to make sure that our nurses look more like our patients,\u201d says Sanchez, who knows firsthand the transformative effect of UW Nurse Camp.\n\nGrowing up in Wenatchee, Sanchez knew she wanted to attend college, despite the barriers standing in her way. Her parents had not been able to pursue higher education, and while they worked hard to provide better opportunities for Sanchez and her siblings, they couldn\u2019t help navigate the college admissions process.Then a high school counselor encouraged Sanchez to apply to UW Nurse Camp. The suggestion changed the course of her life.\n\nAt camp, Sanchez quickly adapted to long days shadowing nurses at UW Medical Center and learning the ins and outs of nursing school. By the end of the week, Sanchez could see herself in the field. And she found something she didn\u2019t expect: \u201cOne of the main things Nurse Camp did for me was give me confidence,\u201d she says. \u201cThe camp mentors (nursing students, faculty, staff and alumni) made me believe in myself and that I was good enough. I didn\u2019t see college being a possibility until I went to Nurse Camp.\u201d\n\nSanchez got into the University of Washington, and then applied to nursing school. \u201cSomething that really attracted me to the <a href=\"https:\/\/nursing.uw.edu\/\">UW School of Nursing<\/a> was its commitment to diversity,\u201d she says. \u201cNurse Camp donors didn\u2019t only invest in a student, they invested in my future and the future of nursing.\u201d\n\nThroughout her time at the UW, Sanchez \u2014 now a senior in the nursing program \u2014 has received support from dedicated mentors and staff, and is paying it forward as Nurse Camp co-lead. \u201cTo see her go from camper to nursing student to Nurse Camp lead is incredible,\u201d says Carolyn Chow, director of admissions and multicultural student affairs at the School of Nursing, and one of the camp\u2019s founders. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what the camp is all about \u2014 empowering high school students to aggressively pursue their dreams.\u201d\n\nAlong the way, Sanchez picked up a degree in <a href=\"http:\/\/sph.washington.edu\/\">public health<\/a> in addition to her nursing studies, and she plans to pursue her doctor of nursing practice at the UW. Eventually, she hopes to fuse the two fields and provide community health care in her hometown. \u201cHer future is limitless,\u201d Chow says proudly. \u201cWe will continue to be in a better world because of Karissa.\u201d\n\nSanchez, the first in her family to attend a four-year college, credits UW Nurse Camp for leading her to where she is today, as well as creating a broader impact. \u201cMy story is tangible,\u201d says Sanchez. \u201cI know that by something as simple as me going to Nurse Camp, I\u2019ve changed the trajectory of my family.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>UW NURSE CAMP<\/strong>\n\nInterest in <a href=\"https:\/\/nursing.uw.edu\/about\/uw-nurse-camp\">UW Nurse Camp<\/a> \u2014 now gearing up for its eighth year\u2014is growing at an incredible rate. In 2015, 148 high school students applied for just 24 spots. Much of the program\u2019s success is thanks to the undaunted work of volunteers and the generous support of donors. To ensure that the camp is an option for students from all backgrounds, the program charges no fees to attend. Thanks to the generosity of many, Nurse Camp can open the doors to college for many more students like Sanchez, continuing to create a more inclusive nursing workforce.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/giving\/make-a-gift\/?page=make&amp;code=NURCAM\">Support UW Nurse Camp<\/a> and other leading-edge student programs at <a href=\"http:\/\/uw.edu\/giving\">uw.edu\/giving<\/a>.\n\n&nbsp;"},{"title":"Engineers Without Borders: From UW to Guatemala","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/engineers-without-borders-from-uw-to-guatemala\/","tags":["engineering","college-of-the-environment","giving","global","graduate-student","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"Through Engineers Without Borders, 40 UW students are taking\u00a0on various projects in the Guatamelan village of La Vega del Volcan, from re-designing\u00a0a fish hatchery to constructing a town meeting space.","content":"(The Whole U, December 2015)\n\nThe UW chapter of Engineers Without Borders approaches each new project with a simple question.\n\n\u201cWe go to the community and ask what are their greatest needs,\u201d said group president Bryan Bednarski, a junior in the Department of Electrical Engineering.\n\nThe answer isn\u2019t always so simple, but the aim is always the same: \u201cWe want to improve lives and infrastructure,\u201d Bryan said.\n\nMade up of about 40 students, Engineers Without Borders enables students to apply what they\u2019ve learned to real-life development challenges. They work right here on campus, with projects such as designing a greenhouse and cob oven for the UW Farm. This trains younger students for larger international projects.\n\nTheir current project is in La Vega del Volcan, a rural mountain town in Guatemala. The group made a five-year commitment to work there collaboratively.\n\n\u201cThe original project was the fish hatchery,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cAbout a third of the community are members of the trout collective. We came to increase efficiency and yield.\u201d\n\nThe ability to raise fish is critical: about 65% of this remote community\u2019s food is produced locally. They revamped the hatchery so that the water was distributed evenly for the incubation system. The hatchery went from producing less than 2,000 eggs per year to 25,000.\n\nNow they\u2019ve taken on an even larger project: a gathering space for the 750 residents of the town. The community identified this as something they needed because they had no formal play space for the town\u2019s 350 children or a market space for regional vendors. The hope is that this multi-use space will become a hub for the entire town.\n\nThey didn\u2019t just ask for a community center. The town was required to donate 10% of the cost of the project in either cash or volunteer hours. At an overall cost of $40,000, the contribution was significant.\n\n\u201cThey did heavy duty work,\u201d said Daniel Hernandez, a graduate student in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences and the group\u2019s translator. \u201cWe removed about four dump trucks of clay soil with no power tools in high altitude. They took time away from their farms and families to do this.\u201d\n\nThey successfully laid a foundation for the play field last January. Now their goal is to add concrete bleachers and a metal roof to offer protection from the frequent rain. Five members of Engineers Without Boarders with travel back to La Vega this January to continue the project.\n\nBryan said the most rewarding part of their last trip to La Vega was building mutual trust, because the community had previously had negative experiences with international mining companies. \u201cWe had to work to show that what we were saying was what we believed. It was a learning process and a lot of time it was us working together.\u201d\n\nFor Daniel, it was seeing how their work has led to other positive changes. \u201cAside from the interaction [with locals], which is quite an experience for those of us living in the developed world, our project has brought light to this community. They\u2019ve started investing money on the roads. The municipality is doing more.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019d like to get involved, contact Daniel at dh38@uw.edu or Technical Lead Marissa Karpack at mnk5@u.washington.edu for more information. They also let me know that Engineers Without Borders is currently seeking a new Civil Engineering faculty advisor.\n\nYou can donate through the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cfd.wa.gov\/search.aspx\">Combined Fund Drive<\/a> with charity code 1479079 so that more students can work on this project. Esther Chang, a junior in Civil Engineering and the group\u2019s publicity director, explained that grant money can only pay for building materials. The group pays must cover travel expenses, so your donations would enable more students to volunteer.\n\n&nbsp;"},{"title":"UW class pairs students with inmates for unique learning experience","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/uw-class-pairs-students-with-inmates-for-unique-learning-experience\/","tags":["arts-sciences","faculty","giving","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good","student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"For the inmates, the \u201cmixed-enrollment\u201d course held at the prison was a rare chance to study alongside UW students in an academically rigorous setting.

But this isn\u2019t any ordinary classroom, and it isn\u2019t your usual group of university students. The UW students were taking the autumn quarter class on culture, crime and criminal justice alongside 10 male classmates who brought more than theoretical knowledge to the table \u2014 all are serving time at the Monroe Correctional Complex northeast of Seattle.\n\nFor the inmates, the \u201cmixed-enrollment\u201d course held at the prison was a rare chance to study alongside fourth-year UW students in an academically rigorous setting. For the UW students, it was an equally rare opportunity to get a sense of how issues discussed in class play out in real life. To meet with their classmates, they had to undergo security checks, pass through metal gates and walk by an outdoor recreation area secured with razor-wire fencing.\n\n\u201cWe talk about mass incarceration \u2014 we talk about 2.2 million people in the U.S. imprisoned \u2014 but getting to know these people, that\u2019s completely different,\u201d said UW student Meron Fikru.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taught to fear prisoners. We\u2019re taught to distance ourselves from them,\u201d she said. \u201cBut these guys are brilliant. They\u2019re funny and they\u2019re humble and they\u2019re so respectful. It\u2019s been a really humanizing experience.\u201d\n\nClassmate Becky Womelsdorf plans to attend law school and said the course provided something a traditional classroom setting could not.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really beneficial to learn about these issues from a perspective that\u2019s different from what we\u2019re usually exposed to,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not something you can get anywhere else.\u201d\n\nThe class was taught by <a href=\"https:\/\/lsj.washington.edu\/people\/steve-herbert\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u>Steve Herbert<\/u><\/a>, a UW professor and director of the <a href=\"https:\/\/lsj.washington.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u>Law, Societies &amp; Justice<\/u><\/a> program. It\u2019s the third mixed-enrollment class that Herbert, a past recipient of the UW\u2019s distinguished teaching award, has taught at the prison. The topics have varied, but all have been fourth-year courses.\n\nHerbert\u2019s goal is to provide an intellectually stimulating experience for all students, and he said the UW students are often taken aback at how prepared their prison counterparts are.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very good classmates,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a very clear expectation that the students are meant to carry the load of the conversation, and the [prison] students are very well-prepared.\u201d\n\nHannah Schwendeman welcomed the challenge. \u201cYou need to be prepared for class,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving partners for learning who are so passionate and so informed has been great.\u201d\n\nInmate Noel Caldellis, 28, had no college education when he came to prison in 2008 on a first-degree murder conviction. He\u2019s now working on a bachelor\u2019s in history and said taking Herbert\u2019s classes instilled confidence in his abilities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s helped me understand just how close we are to college students who are on the outside,\u201d said Caldellis, who is scheduled for release in 2029. \u201cBesides circumstance and education, we are just as capable of doing college-level work.\u201d\n\nThe UW class is offered through <a href=\"http:\/\/www.universitybeyondbars.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u>University Beyond Bars<\/u><\/a>, a Seattle nonprofit that provides college courses for prisoners. The organization offers about 30 classes at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.doc.wa.gov\/facilities\/prison\/mcc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u>Washington State Reformatory and the Minimum Security Unit<\/u><\/a> in Monroe, including a Saturday night arts and lecture series, college courses for students pursuing associate degrees, and non-credit courses.\n\nThe UW courses are made possible through the <a href=\"https:\/\/lsj.washington.edu\/news\/2014\/09\/10\/endowed-fund-honors-memory-timothy-richard-wettack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u>Timothy Richard Wettack Fund<\/u><\/a>, named in honor of a Law, Societies &amp; Justice alum who was impassioned about prison issues.\u00a0They are non-credit, since the university\u2019s tuition fees would be out of reach for inmates. Washington law currently prohibits using state funds for higher education courses in prison, but state lawmakers have considered a bill that would eliminate the ban.\n\nUniversity Beyond Bars aims to address educational inequity, improve inmates\u2019 chances of employment after release and reduce recidivism rates. A 2013 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rand.org\/news\/press\/2013\/08\/22.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u>study<\/u><\/a> found that inmates who participate in prison education programs have 43 percent lower odds of returning to prison than inmates who do not.\n\nThe UW classes emulate a regular classroom experience as closely as possible, with the same expectations and course load for everyone, said Stacey Reeh, University Beyond Bars\u2019 executive director.\n\n\u201cOur students want to be held to the same standards,\u201d she said. \u201cOur goal is to recreate the university classroom, and these classes really do that. They really feel like they are taking a University of Washington class.\u201d\n\nPrison is often a racially segregated environment, Reeh said, but the classes bring together inmates from diverse backgrounds. Students learn skills that are important on the outside, she said, like critical thinking and effective communication. Some become leaders across the prison, communicating with upper-level administrators and even state legislators.\n\nDevon Adams, who is serving time for first-degree murder, sits on the program\u2019s 19-member\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.universitybeyondbars.org\/leadership\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u>advisory committee<\/u><\/a>. He works as a UBB teaching assistant and tutors fellow inmates in college prep math courses. He\u2019s just two courses away from completing a bachelor\u2019s degree through Ohio University, but it\u2019s been a long road to get there.\n\nIn his early days of imprisonment, Adams said, he saw no path forward. Education gave him something positive to focus on. He first took an English class, and to his surprise, got a B.\n\n\u201cI was used to Cs and Ds and barely passing, so I thought, \u2018man, maybe I can do this,'\u201d said Adams, 36, who is scheduled for release in 2024. \u201cI began to build this confidence, and now I\u2019m thinking about what possibilities life has to offer.\u201d\n\nAdams has taken two of Herbert\u2019s classes and plans to pursue a graduate degree. He wants to be a positive role model for his daughter, who is graduating from high school in the spring and hopes to attend UW.\n\n\u201cI can tell her, \u2018This is what your daddy\u2019s doing,'\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not in here squandering opportunities away and disregarding the pain I put my family through,\u201d said Adams.\n\n\u201cA big part of my rehabilitation, a big part of my transformation, has to do with wanting to make my family proud of me in some way. That\u2019s really a motivating factor for me,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the end of the class, the last of the quarter, the students gather to share their suggestions for developing a restorative justice program. Then UW student Nathan Bean presents the inmates with cards their classmates signed that morning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an understatement to say that these are the very least we could provide for you,\u201d he said. \u201cThis experience is going to stay with us, and it means a lot more than these cards are going to convey. It has been an honor for us to be here and learn alongside you.\u201d"},{"title":"UW gets grant to work on device for paralyzed limbs","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/uw-gets-grant-to-work-on-device-for-paralyzed-limbs\/","tags":["engineering","faculty","school-of-medicine"],"pillars":["innovation"],"image":"","excerpt":"UW's Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering received $16M to work on first implantable device to reanimate paralyzed limbs.","content":"(News &amp; Info, December 2015)\n\nIn the next decade, people who have suffered a spinal cord injury or stroke could have their mobility improved or even restored through a radically new technology: implantable devices that can send signals between regions of the brain or nervous system that have been disconnected due to injury.\n\nThat\u2019s the mission driving the<a href=\"http:\/\/www.csne-erc.org\/\">Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering<\/a>, a University of Washington-led effort that includes researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, San Diego State University and other partners.\n\nTo support development of this much-needed technology, the National Science Foundation recently renewed the center\u2019s funding. It has awarded $16 million over the next four years to support research on implantable devices that promote brain plasticity and reanimate paralyzed limbs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge unmet need, especially with an aging population of baby boomers, for developing the next generation of medical devices for helping people with progressive or traumatic neurological conditions such as stroke and spinal cord injury,\u201d said CSNE director and UW professor of computer science and engineering <a href=\"https:\/\/homes.cs.washington.edu\/~rao\/\">Rajesh Rao<\/a>.\n\nThe goal is to achieve proof-of-concept demonstrations in humans within the next five years, Rao said. This will lay the groundwork for eventual clinical devices approved by the Food and Drug Administration, in collaboration with the center\u2019s industry partners.\n\nCSNE was founded in 2011 with an $18.5 million NSF grant. Since then, its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csne-erc.org\/research\/members?field_team_role_tid=26&amp;field_areas_of_expertise_tid=All&amp;field_team_affiliation_tid=All\">interdisciplinary team<\/a> of neuroscientists, engineers, computer scientists, neurosurgeons, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csne-erc.org\/research\/neuroethics\">ethicists<\/a> and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.csne-erc.org\/industry\">industry partners<\/a> has led the way in developing \u201cbi-directional\u201d implantable devices that can both pick up brain signals and send information to other parts of the nervous system.\n\nThe devices record and decode electrical signals generated by the brain when a person forms an intention, for example, to move a hand to pick up a cup. The devices are also able to wirelessly transmit that information, essentially creating a new artificial pathway around damaged areas of the brain or nervous system.\n\n\u201cWhen Christopher Reeve sustained a spinal cord injury due to a fall from his horse, his brain circuits were still intact and able to form the intention to move, but unfortunately the injury prevented that intention from being conveyed to the spinal cord,\u201d Rao said.\n\n\u201cOur implantable devices aim to bridge such lost connections by decoding brain signals and stimulating the appropriate part of the spinal cord to enable the person to move again,\u201d he said.\n\nThe same technology could also be used to promote plasticity for targeted rehabilitation in stroke and spinal cord injury patients \u2014 essentially reconnecting brain or spinal regions and helping the nervous system repair and rewire itself.\n\nCSNE is also working on improving today\u2019s implantable technologies, such as deep brain stimulators used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease and tremors. These typically deliver electric pulses to the brain at an appropriate frequency that\u2019s adjusted by a physician to achieve the desired effect.\n\nBut this means that the brain is constantly bombarded by electrical pulses even when a person is resting and the pulses aren\u2019t needed. This can lead to unwanted side effects and drain the implantable device\u2019s battery, leading to more frequent replacement surgeries.\n\nBy contrast, CSNE researchers and industry partners are working on a next generation of\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/news\/2015\/04\/14\/uw-among-select-universities-to-use-investigational-medtronic-device-advance-research-into-brain-activity\/\">\u201cclosed loop\u201d implantable devices<\/a> that monitor the brain and deliver targeted electrical stimulation only when it\u2019s needed.\n\n\u201cThis funding renewal for CSNE will allow us to advance the frontiers in closed-loop neural interfaces,\u201d said CSNE deputy director <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/moritlab\/\">Chet Moritz<\/a>, a UW associate professor of rehabilitation medicine and of physiology &amp; biophysics. \u201cWe have a fantastic team of engineers and neuroscientists working closely together, and continued NSF support is critical to achieving these ambitious goals.\u201d\n\nThe NSF funding will also enable the center to expand its already popular <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csne-erc.org\/education\">outreach and education programs<\/a> for K-12 students, school teachers, undergraduates and veterans to other partner institutions.

But when the <a href=\"https:\/\/music.washington.edu\/\">UW School of Music<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pacificmusicworks.org\/\">Pacific MusicWorks <\/a>present the <em>Messiah<\/em> on December 12-13 in Meany Hall, there will be some surprises along with the familiar.\n\nThe innovative production will be conducted by Pacific MusicWorks director Stephen Stubbs, senior artist in residence in the School of Music, working closely with Geoffrey Boers, School of Music director of choral activities and conductor of the UW Chamber Singers. Four professional singers will join the Pacific MusicWorks Orchestra and the <a href=\"https:\/\/music.washington.edu\/ensembles\/chamber-singers\">UW Chamber Singers <\/a>as soloists for the production.\n\n\u201cOur experimental partnership with Pacific MusicWorks embodies a quite old-fashioned idea,\u201d says Richard Karpen, director of the School of Music. \u201cIt\u2019s the idea that student artists thrive and grow more quickly by working in the studios and on stage in world-class productions, singing and playing side-by-side with already accomplished professionals. Stephen Stubbs, a Grammy Award-winning music director, is our ideal partner for this.\u201d\n\nStubbs has conducted <em>Messiah\u00a0<\/em>performances before, but never with the artistic freedom provided by the UW. In the past, working with symphonies as a guest conductor, he would arrive days before a performance with little opportunity for artistic input. At the UW, he has had months to brainstorm with Boers and test ideas with the UW Chamber Singers. \u201cFrom the very get-go, it\u2019s really been a collaboration,\u201d says Boers. \u201cStephen and I talked all summer long, deciding what would be best for the choir and the soloists and the piece overall.\u201d\n\nThe result is a subtle and complex <em>Messiah, <\/em>with unexpected pairings of soloist, choir, quartet, and full orchestra that create texture and heighten Handel\u2019s dramatic intent. \u201cThere will be many layers of dimensionality,\u201d says Stubbs. \u201cIt\u2019s an experiment that\u2019s been running around in my head ever since I\u2019ve been doing <em>Messiah<\/em>, but it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been able to conceptually shape the whole thing. We have the luxury of excellent ingredients\u2014an already high level of musicianship in the UW choir\u2014but also the academic setting that allows for experimentation. I\u2019m extremely excited about the results.\"\n\nThe most obvious break from recent tradition is the embedding of the soloists in the choir, as was the custom in Handel\u2019s day.\u00a0 \u201cThe normal situation is that you have a choir and you have soloists, and they don\u2019t have much to do with each other,\u201d explains Stubbs. \u201cBut in this production the soloists are the first among equals as part of the choir. That was the original intent when the piece was written, but it\u2019s very rare today.\u201d\n\nFor those who love the familiar <em>Messiah\u00a0<\/em>they\u2019ve heard for years, Stubbs and Boers assure that despite some changes, all the drama and majesty are still there. Like the rest of us, Stubbs considers <em>Messiah<\/em> a masterpiece worthy of immense respect. \u201cOne thing that always strikes me is that once you\u2019ve heard certain phrases\u2014I\u2019m talking about the way the music fits the language\u2014the texts become part of our deep language, like something very deep in our DNA,\u201d says Stubbs. \u201cIt\u2019s inescapable. Handel has found a way to fit text to music just like hand in glove.\u201d\n\nBoers, who has conducted <em>Messiah<\/em> for regional choirs for many years, finds that the piece takes on a life of its own each year. He suspects that this year will be no different.\n\n\u201c<em>Messiah<\/em> tends to reflect the zeitgeist of what\u2019s going on, and it has since the time it was written,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery movement has its own dialog, with themes of darkness and light, desolation and hope, the dashing into pieces and the rising up. These paradoxes become really personal. I think it\u2019s quite profound, and I think that\u2019s why it has endured all these years.\u201d"},{"title":"Helping children navigate life's challenges","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/helping-children-navigate-lifes-challenges\/","tags":["arts-sciences","faculty"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"Through a pilot program, parents learn how they can help their children develop the skills of self-regulation and effortful control.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, December 2015)\n\nImagine you\u2019re five years old.

Research suggests that these skills help children navigate social and emotional situations and serve as buffers from the effects of stress and adversity. \u00a0Unfortunately children facing the most adversity\u2014those raised in disadvantaged families\u2014often lag in developing effortful control, with those delays continuing into adulthood.\n\nIn a two-year study of preschoolers, starting at age three, Lengua found that children from low-income households consistently had lower effortful control. \u201cThose children were showing differences even at the very start of the study,\u201d says Lengua, \u201cand those differences persisted over the two-year period.\u201d\n\nThe good news is that parenting matters. A lot. When the research team observed parents interacting with their children, certain parent behaviors were related to better development of effortful control in their children. \u201cOnce we took those parenting behaviors into account, the effects of poverty on children\u2019s development of effortful control became nonsignificant\u2014near zero, in fact,\u201d says Lengua.\n\nBased on these findings, Lengua developed a parenting program to share these effective parenting behaviors more broadly. The program has been piloted in two early learning settings serving low-income families, with a larger pilot in the works. \u201cThere are other parenting programs that address difficult behaviors,\u201d says Lengua, \u201cbut this one is designed explicitly to help parents support and promote their child\u2019s self-regulation development, which will hopefully serve as a protective factor as those children navigate through school and challenging situations.\u201d\n\nThe six-session parent program, led by a facilitator, features two central concepts: scaffolding and mindfulness. Scaffolding involves knowing when to step in and support your child and when to step out and let the child figure things out autonomously. \u00a0\u201cI use the analogy of coaching,\u201d says Lengua. \u201cThe coach supports and trains the players, and then when game time comes, the coach stays on the sideline while the team plays the game. As much as we want to jump in and help our children to ensure a positive outcome, sometimes it\u2019s important to step back and not manage the situation.\u201d\n\nThe other concept, mindfulness, concerns making the effort to be present, warm, and positively engaged in interactions with our children. Research has shown that harsh and negative parenting disrupts a child\u2019s stress hormone response, which can affect cognitive development and hinder self-regulation and effortful control.\n\nAs any parent knows, scaffolding and mindfulness are more challenging than they might sound, especially if the parent is having a bad day. But practice helps. Lengua\u2019s pilot program features scaffolding exercises in class, followed by assignments to try at home. It also includes tools for managing stress. \u201cThese tools aim at being present and engaged, and regulating your own emotions, so you can be your best self in your interactions with your child,\u201d says Lengua. \u201cParents in the pilot study have commented that they used the mindfulness and emotion regulation tools with their boss or husband as much as with their kids, so we\u2019re hoping it translates to new tools for parents to use in other settings too.\u201d\n\nResults from the pilot program are promising, with parents showing increases in warmth and scaffolding and children demonstrating a noticeable increase in positive behaviors based on before-and-after comparisons. Lengua plans to expand the pilot to reach more families and to include a control group for before-and-after evaluations. Looking ahead, she hopes to refine the program so that it can be used more broadly, with minimal facilitator training required. (For the pilot, she has partnered with preschool programs that include a skilled parent educator.)\n\n\u201cThough we are studying the development of effortful control and social and emotional outcomes in kids, we are targeting our interventions at parents because we believe that is where we can have the greatest impact,\u201d says Lengua. \u201cBy promoting positive parenting during childhood, we can potentially prevent lifelong adverse outcomes.\u201d\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 .\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0.<\/p>\n<em>For more about Liliana Lengua\u2019s work, visit her <a href=\"http:\/\/www.psych.uw.edu\/psych.php?p=358&amp;PersonID=58\">web page<\/a>.

As more and more people are moving to urban centers throughout the world, what will the modern city look like? How will we ensure that all of its residents, rich or poor, are able to access public goods and services? And for all the creative energy that a city harnesses in one place, how will we make sure that no one is shunted to its margins, left to fall through the cracks?\n\nThese are just some of the questions students began to tackle at NextSeattle, an intensive four-day workshop sponsored by CoMotion, <a href=\"http:\/\/urban.uw.edu\/\">Urban@UW<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/uaa\/\">Undergraduate Academic Affairs<\/a>, and the <a href=\"http:\/\/escience.washington.edu\/\">UW eScience Institute<\/a>.

Hanauer talked of how the needs of society will always outpace society\u2019s capacity to fix its own problems, necessitating social and civic innovation. Love spoke about the need for businesses to have social impact in their communities, and Millines-Dziko inspired students with her own story of becoming an entrepreneur and leader.\n\n\u201cBesides marshaling the university\u2019s resources in the service of some of society\u2019s biggest challenges, the workshop\u2019s purpose was to teach students how to hone their ideas in teams\u201d said Vikram Jandhyala, UW Vice Provost for Innovation and executive director at <a href=\"http:\/\/comotion.uw.edu\/\">CoMotion<\/a>. \u201cWe want everyone to understand innovation, even if they don\u2019t become entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nOver the course of the weekend, students were divided into ten teams and were charged with addressing one of the four challenges through design thinking and social innovation. Students solicited feedback from the University District community and had access to the <a href=\"http:\/\/comotion.uw.edu\/makerspace\">CoMotion Makerspace<\/a> in Fluke Hall, a community-centered space that provides tools, equipment and an open environment. Students also connected with social service providers and policy leaders active in the U-District.\n\nOn Monday, each team pitched their idea to a panel of judges, which selected the top three teams. The third-place team developed a concept called \u201cUrban Beacon,\u201d a means to address hunger in the U-District by strengthening networks among people who are homeless, and leveraging their knowledge of food-procurement opportunities. The second-place team, looking to combat the de-humanizing anonymity to which a city can sometimes subject its citizens, proposed \u201cSay Hello\u201d\u2014a digital platform that would foster a sense of community with photos of locals and personal narratives. The winning team developed an idea called \u201cJobBox,\u201d a mobile career center particularly focused on services for youth who are homeless that would provide counseling support to help job retention.\n\nThe second- and third-place teams were each awarded a $500 <a href=\"mailto:Urban@UW\">Urban@UW<\/a> Feasibility Team Award to develop their concept further, while the first-place team members each received a $1,000 CoMotion Mary Gates Innovation Scholar award, along with a $1,000 CoMotion Feasibility Team Award.\n\n\u201cAll the ideas were fantastic,\u201d Way told the teams. \u201cThe way you are thinking about the future is groundbreaking.\u201d"},{"title":"Combating global climate change is fun and games for EarthGamesUW","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/combating-global-climate-change-is-fun-and-games-for-earthgamesuw\/","tags":["college-of-the-environment","faculty","graduate-student"],"pillars":["innovation"],"image":"","excerpt":"EarthGamesUW, a new group at the University of Washington's College of the Environment, is inspiring kids to combat climate change through gaming.\n\n&nbsp;","content":"(College of the Environment, December 2015)\n\nMany adults share the idea that kids in our digital age should be spending more time outdoors.

When she passed away, her husband of nearly 60 years, Robert Barnes, decided to honor her with a gift to the UW that reflected her lifelong passion for literature and travel. His generous bequest created the <a href=\"https:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/engl\/ugrad\/wingstolondon.php\">Wings to London Scholarship <\/a>in the <a href=\"https:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/engl\/\">Department of English<\/a>, which helps cover travel expenses for English majors enrolled in the department\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/engl\/abroad\/londonspring16.php\">Spring in London <\/a>program.\n\n\u201cOur parents always encouraged each of us to go beyond our own boundaries, to get out of our comfort zone with different cultures and ideas,\u201d says Julie Morrison, Robert and June Barnes\u2019 daughter. \u201cWe weren't rich, but they knew the importance of travel and the impact it would have on our lives.\u201d\n\nThrough their gift, the Barnes family left a legacy with lasting impact for UW students. The scholarship recipients will never know June and Robert Barnes\u2014Robert passed away before the gift was finalized\u2014but Morrison meets the recipients of her parents\u2019 scholarship. \u201cIf this endowment helps students start their own explorations,\u201d says Morrison, \u201cwe are thrilled!\u201d\n<h4>PHILOSOPHY, PHYSICS, PASSION<\/h4>\nPatrick O\u2019Hara (Ph.D., Biochemistry, 1980) has had a lifelong interest in physics, cosmology, and philosophy. He and his wife reached out to the UW Departments of <a href=\"https:\/\/sharepoint.washington.edu\/phys\/Pages\/default.aspx\">Physics <\/a>and <a href=\"https:\/\/phil.washington.edu\/\">Philosophy<\/a> to create two lecture series, one in Physics and one in the Philosophy of Physics. \u201cWe think that the coming century poses enormous, unprecedented challenges to humans and other species on the plant,\u201d says O\u2019Hara, \u201cand telling the community the story of the cosmos is a way to inspire people to deal with those challenges.\u201d\n<div class=\"fig-fix-wrap right\"><\/div>\nO\u2019Hara and his wife wanted to tell the story of science in a way that explores not just the mechanics of quantum theory but also the resulting shifts in perspective. \u201cThe \u2018philosophical\u2019 stakes of physics and cosmology are enormous, and touch on things like the possibilities of supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and the idea that we live in but one universe in a multiverse,\u201d says O\u2019Hara. \u201cDiscoveries since the early 20th century have radically altered our view of time and space. These discoveries have practical uses and significance to our view of the universe every bit as radical as realizing we're revolving around the sun. They affect all of us, our mindsets.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Hara\u2019s gifts bring in experts from both philosophy and physics to share their passions with UW students and the community. \u201cI am motivated to share my inspiration with students throughout the UW, whatever their area of study,\u201d O\u2019Hara says. \u201cScientific achievements are our pyramids, our cathedrals. They are our most spectacular and profound edifices.

When Wick began giving two years ago, the School matched her with PATP actor Rudy Roushdi, and thanks to her support, Roushdi will have a leg up in the industry.\n\n\u201cIn a market like LA or NYC, most actors spend years knocking on doors trying to just get into the room,\u201d says Roushdi. \u201cThe funds will help me as I begin to travel to LA and New York in April to audition. It will be invaluable for me.\u201d\n\nBut Wick and Roushdi\u2019s relationship is about more than the money. They have developed a strong mentorship between them. They started off meeting for coffee so Wick could understand what the program was like; now they talk about school, life, and Roushdi\u2019s work. \u201cShe is a friend and a mentor and a person I hope to stay close with even after I graduate,\u201d says Roushdi.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve greatly enjoyed watching him develop as an actor,\u201d says Wick, who attends all of Roushdi\u2019s shows and has even observed his teaching. \u201cHe graduates in June, and I can\u2019t help wishing he\u2019ll stay in Seattle, though of course I will try to keep in touch and wish him success wherever he goes.

When he graduates in 2018, it will be 101 years since his great-grandfather, Yasukuchi Chiba, earned his degree in Pharmacy. In fact, Beau Chiba is the sixth member of his family to attend the school.\n\nHis family\u2019s story echoes the social, political, and economic ebbs and flows of the last century.\n\nShirosabura Chiba, Beau\u2019s great-great-grandfather on his father\u2019s side, was a pharmacist who emigrated to the United States from Japan with his young family. When his son, Yasukuchi, graduated from the UW in 1917, he worked with his dad and operated several pharmacies in the Seattle-Tacoma area, including Main Drug in Seattle\u2019s International District.\n\nTwenty years later, in 1937, Yasukuchi\u2019s son Bain graduated with his pharmacy degree and began work at Main Drug. Bain\u2019s brother-in-law, Noboru \u201cNibs\u201d Morio, began his pharmacy studies at UW just before WWII. Mary Shimoda, who would later marry Nibs, was also a student there.\n\nIn early 1942, all four members of the family were practicing or learning pharmacy when President Roosevelt, on the heels of Pearl Harbor, signed an executive order to relocate 120,000 Japanese-Americans to internment centers. Family members were forced to leave their homes in south Seattle and Beacon Hill. Automobiles were impounded, homes and property sold. Main Drug was lost.\n\nThe Chibas initially spent months at a short-term detention center on the Puyallup fairgrounds, living in shacks and on limited food rations. The Army called it Camp Harmony, laughably.\n\nThe UW president and faculty advocated for their students. President L.P. Seig wrote letters to 25 college presidents begging them to take UW\u2019s Nikkei students. Most schools didn\u2019t want the students. One dean went to Puyallup to hold an informal graduation ceremony for Nikkei students who were just one month from commencement.\n<div class=\"asset-wrapper asset aid-638 asset-image view-mode-290x480-inset-image asset-align-right\"><\/div>\nWeeks later, the group was moved to the Minidoka internment camp in Idaho. Among them was Mary Shimoda, Nibs\u2019 future wife, and her mother and sister. \u00a0An outstanding student, Shimoda in 1942 was named to Rho Chi, a pharmacy honor society, in absentia, while she was at the Idaho camp.\n\nNationwide, there was a shortage of labor, and some internees were able to leave camps. Bain, a knowledgeable pharmacist, was transferred to the University of Michigan hospital. When he could afford it, he moved his family to safety in Michigan, where they lived out the war.\n\nNibs took a different path. He enlisted to serve with the 442nd Infantry Regiment. With the motto, \u201cGo for Broke,\u201d the Japanese-American regiment was the most decorated in U.S. military history for its size and length of service. Nibs was deployed to Italy and then France, earning two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star.\n\nIn 1946, Nibs married Shimoda; she had left camp by transferring to Idaho State University to complete her education. Nibs eventually retired from his Army post as a hospital pharmacist and returned to the UW to finish the education he had started 20 years earlier. Upon graduation, he moved with Mary to Bellevue, where they continued to practice pharmacy, she at Group Health and he at Overlake Hospital.\n\nBain and his family returned to Seattle a few years after the war ended. He was able to resume ownership of Main Drugs, even as hard times persisted for Japanese-Americans in the Northwest. For the Chibas, the International District community was a safe harbor.\n\nIn 1966, 20 years after they married, Nibs and Mary\u2019s son Dave (Beau\u2019s cousin) enrolled in the UW School of Pharmacy, graduating in 1971. Later he owned and operated Fife Pharmacy and, as a UW clinical assistant professor, helped precept many students.\n\nIn 2008, the UW Board of Regents voted to issue 450 honorary degrees to students who had been pulled from the classroom and sent to internment camps and war. Among the honorary grads were Nibs and Mary.\n\nThe Chiba-Morio family history reflects the pharmacy profession\u2019s changes over the last century. Main Drugs closed in 1978; condos now sit in its place. As physicians left the area and drug reimbursements dwindled, Dave closed Fife Pharmacy in 2010, after 25 years. He now works for Safeway pharmacy.\n\nLast fall, Beau Chiba picked up the family mantle by enrolling at UW.\n\n\u201cI never got to meet my grandfather, but I\u2019ve been told he was a character and that I\u2019m just like him,\u201d Beau said. \u201cI chose UW School of Pharmacy to stay connected to my family history. It feels like home.\u201d"},{"title":"In Focus: Crew standout spent the summer fighting fires","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/in-focus-crew-standout-spent-the-summer-fighting-fires\/","tags":["athletics","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"A member of the National Guard, UW senior rower Danielle Olson was called into service to fight the wildfires in Eastern Washington this summer.","content":"(UW Athletics, October 2015)\n<p class=\"p1\"><a id=\"biolink_5\" class=\"biolink\" href=\"http:\/\/www.gohuskies.com\/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=1044610&amp;SPID=160608&amp;ATCLID=209985719&amp;DB_OEM_ID=30200\">Danielle Olson<\/a> wasn\u2019t a student this summer.

Every stroke has to be the same as the one before, just as fresh, just as strong, just as powerful.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Instead of focusing on a stroke or her team, Olson took her rowing mentality and applied it to digging hotline trenches to help contain the blaze or searching for hot spots once the fire subsided.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She told herself, \u201cI need to work as hard as I can. I don\u2019t want to burn out. I\u2019m really fit. I need to show all the skills I have while I\u2019m here and represent.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Olson\u2019s journey east started while inspecting vehicles as part of her National Guard responsibilities. She was working on trucks at Boeing Field, doing routine maintenance, checking the tires, oil, washer fluid and ensuring there was no physical damage to the vehicles.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At the time, the wildfires were getting worse. Members of the National Guard were asked to volunteer. Olson was one of 12 people who offered to help. But there weren\u2019t enough volunteers to mobilize a unit.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWe knew it was really bad getting worse,\u201d Olson said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Then President Barack Obama declared a state of emergency. Instead of looking for more volunteers, her National Guard unit was deployed.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI was one of the people who had to call and tell people, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re getting deployed. You have to come. You don\u2019t have a choice,\u2019\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Olson said there were a lot of \u201cuncomfortable conversations\u201d as she notified her unit they were heading east. On the day they were deployed, Olson\u2019s unit left at 5 a.m. After medical in-processing, Olson drove a Light Medium Tactical Vehicle (LMTV) loaded with equipment to Yakima.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Before Olson could start fighting fires, she had to go through training.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt was a big learning curve to understand fire behavior,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of the things I learned were so interesting. You have to be quick on your feet, because if you\u2019re not, you\u2019re going to get caught in flame and that\u2019s really bad.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After seven days of preparation, Olson found herself on the frontline of the fire.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou get pretty close to the flame line,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Working with a crew of 20 people, Olson helped dig trenches that were three feet wide and two feet deep.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt\u2019s just soil so the fire can\u2019t jump across,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Working to dig five miles of trench every three days, the crew worked to keep the fire from \u201cjumping over your line.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou have to keep an eye on that,\u201d Olson said. \u201cIf that happens, you have to move your line around or go put that fire out separately.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As one of the more fit members of her crew, Olson took it upon herself to motivate the group.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOK, guys we\u2019re going,\u201d she would tell the members of the group. \u201cWe only have 100 meters left of this line and then we get to go home. Get excited.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Working with a variety of people from different backgrounds, Olson learned there is no one way to get people going.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt\u2019s really good to know how to motivate different people, because different people respond to different things,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At the end of each day, a \u201cdog-tired\u201d Olson would head back to camp.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou\u2019re staggering into the chow line,\u201d she said. \u201cThe food tastes so good, because you\u2019re so hungry. They could have fed me slop and I would have eaten seconds.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After eating, Olson would head straight for her tent.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou crawl into your tent and it\u2019s super uncomfortable when you\u2019re laying on rocks, but you just sleep so well, because you worked all day,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The biggest downside to sleeping in the tent \u2013 the black widow spiders.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cPeople would find spiders in their boots or crawling into their clothes,\u201d Olson said. \u201cThat was a little scary to wake up to in the morning.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After 20 consecutive 16-hour days, Olson was able to head home. She appreciated every minute of her first night on a mattress in a bedroom.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI recognize all the special gifts we have here,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing an athlete, I\u2019m lucky to have access to doctors. I came back with a lot of smoke and ash in my lungs and the doctors had me on inhalers and stuff to get it out so I could be ready for rowing in the spring.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI feel really lucky, because I know other people I worked with probably don\u2019t have that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The experience was enough to convince her to work toward joining a hotshot crew \u2013 an elite group of wildfire firefighters \u2013 \u00a0next summer.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cEveryone knows a hotshot crew,\u201d Olson said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Now a few months removed from the experience, Olson is back to being a student-athlete. She has gone from the fire\u2019s frontline to fall quarter at Washington.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The things that make her a talented athlete helped her while fighting fires and the things she learned in Eastern Washington are helping her in the classroom, with her training and working with her teammates.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cPutting fire into crew, I\u2019m a lot more organized and I can motivate a crew,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Olson uses each experience she encounters as a way to enhance other aspects of her life. Whether rowing, fighting fires or fulfilling her obligation to the National Guard, \u201cThe Machine\u201d doesn\u2019t stop.<\/p>"},{"title":"How makerspaces can be accesible to people with disabilities","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/how-makerspaces-can-be-accesible-to-people-with-disabilities\/","tags":["engineering","comotion","faculty","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"Inside the University of Washington\u2019s CoMotion MakerSpace, students, faculty and staff create, crochet or prototype whatever they can dream up.\u00a0A team of UW researchers released new\u00a0guidelines aimed at ensuring makerspaces are accessible to people with disabilities.","content":"(News &amp; Info, August 2015)\n\nInside the University of Washington\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/comotion.uw.edu\/makerspace\">CoMotion MakerSpace<\/a>, students, faculty and staff use sewing machines to create anime convention costumes, 3-D print models for aeronautics research or make circuits for a custom-built amplifier.\n\nInspired by the DIY movement, these communal spaces with soldering irons, laser cutters, saws, duct tape, pegboards full of tools, butcher paper, crayons and other \u201cmaking\u201d tools are popping up across the country. They enable a broader array of people to tinker, create, crochet or prototype whatever invention they can dream up.\n\nTo ensure those spaces are truly inclusive, a team of UW researchers has released new\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/doit\/making-makerspace-guidelines-accessibility-and-universal-design\">guidelines aimed at ensuring makerspaces are accessible<\/a> to people with disabilities.\n\nThe effort is part of a broader National Science Foundation-funded <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/doit\/programs\/accessengineering\/overview\">AccessEngineering<\/a>\u00a0initiative, which supports students with disabilities in pursuing engineering careers and promotes accessible and universal design in engineering departments and courses.\n\n\u201cA lot of universities are creating these more casual prototyping spaces where students can have more of a DIY experience, as an alternative to a traditional machine shop,\u201d said AccessEngineering co-principal investigator <a href=\"http:\/\/faculty.washington.edu\/kmsteele\/\">Kat Steele<\/a>, a UW assistant professor of mechanical engineering whose <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/uwsteele\/\">Human Ability &amp; Engineering Lab<\/a> focuses on developing tools for people with cerebral palsy, stroke and other movement disorders.\n\n\u201cBecause this is a big growth area for engineering schools, we wanted to help with some best practices and guidelines so that as these new spaces are being created they can be accessible to the widest group possible.\u201d\n\nOn a recent tour of the UW\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/comotion.uw.edu\/news\/comotion-launches-new-makerspace-now-open-all-uw-student-innovators\">6-month-old CoMotion MakerSpace<\/a>, students with an array of disabilities \u2014 from cerebral palsy to vision impairments to autism \u2014 found a lot to like. The open spaces worked for people in wheelchairs, and floors were free of wires that could trip people or snag wheels. A wide range of materials and tools allowed people with differing abilities to find things to work with. Quiet rooms around the perimeter of the space offered a refuge for people with hearing impairments or neurodevelopment disorders who have trouble filtering out background noise.\n\nDuring a prototyping challenge that allowed them to test the tools, though, they ran into some unique challenges in sketching, building and sharing their ideas. Items on their wish list to make the makerspace more usable \u2014 which helped inform the new accessibility guidelines \u2014 included:\n<ul>\n\t<li>large print and braille labels for tools<\/li>\n\t<li>adjustable-height tables with push-button adjustments to accommodate individuals using wheelchairs<\/li>\n\t<li>eliminating tiny drawers that store screws, nuts, bolts and electrical equipment that are difficult for people with motor impairments to open<\/li>\n\t<li>multiple mouse and keyboard options<\/li>\n\t<li>guards on sharp objects so people who use their fingers to \u201csee\u201d won\u2019t inadvertently cut themselves<\/li>\n\t<li>high-contrast, large-print instructional and safety signs<\/li>\n\t<li>making all tools and safety equipment accessible from a seated position<\/li>\n\t<li>having tactile prototyping tools available, such as clay that can be used to quickly \u201csketch and share\u201d ideas<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\u201cThose outlets are my arch nemesis \u2014 I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve been bonked in the head or chest,\u201d Werbel said. \u201cEven if they\u2019re right in front of my face, I can\u2019t see them because of depth perception issues. And a cane wouldn\u2019t pick them up because they\u2019re not on the ground.\u201d Incoming UW freshman Hannah Werbel, who is legally blind and participated in the UW <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/doit\/do-it-scholars\">DO-IT Scholars<\/a> program that helps students with disabilities prepare for college, found the bright yellow electrical outlets hanging from the ceiling \u2014 which are designed to keep wires off the floor \u2014 were at just the right height to be hazardous.\n\nWork tables on wheels were a plus, since they allow people to reconfigure the space as needed and move if people accidentally bump into them. But the students suggested that makerspaces keep equipment \u2014 3-D printers, laser cutters, tools, sewing machines \u2014 in the same location.\n\n\u201cThe everything-on-wheels thing is really good for people in wheelchairs,\u201d said UW sophomore Kayla Wheeler, a congenital amputee who was born with no legs and one arm. \u201cBut I could see how it would be really hard for people who can\u2019t see and are trying to make a mental map of the room if everything keeps moving around.\u201d\n\nThe UW\u2019s AccessEngineering program helps <a href=\"http:\/\/doit-prod.s.uw.edu\/doit\/programs\/accessengineering\/training-faculty\">train faculty<\/a> from across the country in universal design, which means designing spaces, curriculum or environments that work for the widest possible array of people. The program also <a href=\"http:\/\/doit-prod.s.uw.edu\/doit\/programs\/accessengineering\/get-involved\/apply-accessengineering-minigrant\">provides mini-grants<\/a> to help engineering schools incorporate those principles.\n\nThe idea for makerspace guidelines arose, in part, because so many new computer-aided design tools \u2014 such as 3-D printers or laser cutters \u2014 are making it easier for people with disabilities to explore their creativity, prototype ideas and invent.The program has previously released checklists and guidelines for making <a href=\"http:\/\/doit-prod.s.uw.edu\/doit\/equal-access-universal-design-engineering-labs\">engineering labs,<\/a>\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/doit-prod.s.uw.edu\/doit\/equal-access-universal-design-engineering-departments\">departments<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/doit-prod.s.uw.edu\/doit\/equal-access-universal-design-instruction\">instruction<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/doit-prod.s.uw.edu\/doit\/equal-access-universal-design-your-project\">projects<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http:\/\/doit-prod.s.uw.edu\/doit\/checklist-making-computer-labs-accessible-students-disabilities\">computer labs<\/a> inclusive of people with disabilities.

Now, the UW is recognizing her courage with the 2015 Distinguished Alumni Veteran Award.","content":"(Homepage\/Columns, November 2015)\n\nCourage comes in many forms. Retired Army Col. Grethe Cammermeyer \u2014 nurse, Vietnam veteran, Bronze Star recipient and civil rights champion \u2014 mustered yet another form of courage to disclose that she was a lesbian, even though it meant she would lose her job in the military.\n\nThis year\u2019s UW Alumni Association Distinguished Alumni Veteran Award recipient, Cammermeyer is lauded for leading the way for gays in the military. But her story is filled with examples of courage from nursing injured soldiers in war and pursuing a military career when women did not have many opportunities to sharing even the most painful moments of her personal story.\n\nCammermeyer, \u201976, \u201991, started active duty as an Army nurse in 1963. After training and serving abroad, she volunteered to go to Vietnam, where she ultimately became the head nurse of the neurosurgical intensive care unit. After Vietnam, when she was back stateside, married and pregnant with her first child, she was forced into taking an involuntary discharge because military policy dictated that women with babies could not serve in active duty.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t take it as a frustration,\u201d she recalls. \u201cYou just took it as a deal that you made. If you wanted to have a family, you left the Army.\u201d But Cammermeyer wasn\u2019t ready to end her military career just yet. \u201cWhen the policy was changed,\u201d she says, \u201cI immediately started the paperwork to get into the reserves.\u201d\n\nWhile raising four sons and working at VA hospitals in Washington, Cammermeyer earned a master\u2019s degree in nursing at the UW in 1976. But she sought something more. \u201cI wanted to do something at a higher level,\u201d she says, explaining her choice to return to school. \u201cI wanted to be the best \u201cneuro\u201d nurse around.\u201d She completed her Ph.D. in 1991.\n\nIn the middle of it all, with school, work, children and the reserves, \u201csomething went tilt and I didn\u2019t want to be married anymore,\u201d she says. While she was certain of herself professionally, she wasn\u2019t sure about her personal life. Divorced, having lost custody of her sons, she immersed herself in her work. \u201cThe time was emotionally traumatic,\u201d she recalls. \"I was near-suicidal.\u201d\n\nIn 1988, Cammermeyer became chief nurse of the Washington State National Guard. Around that time, she met her future wife, Diane Divelbess, and her personal life became clear. During a security interview to vet her as a candidate for the War College, she revealed her sexual orientation. \u201cI said I was a lesbian, owning it out loud for the first time,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me, it was a matter of honesty.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Established in 2012, the Distinguished Alumni Veteran Award (DAVA) is given to a living University of Washington alumnus veteran who made a positive impact on the local, national or international community, the University of Washington or the veterans\u2019 community.

In a tiny space in the basement of the Communications Building \u2014 with an even tinier budget \u2014 the radio station\u2019s first broadcast just barely reached The Ave.\n\nThat was in 1972. Fast-forward to 2015, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kexp.org\/\">KEXP<\/a> (renamed after a gift from Seattle\u2019s Experience Music Project) is widely regarded as one of the best independent radio stations in the nation \u2014 and around the world. It was KEXP, after all, that first played Nirvana\u2019s debut album <em>Bleach<\/em>on the air. In fact, Kurt Cobain dropped off the demo for the grunge band\u2019s premiere single, \u201cLove Buzz,\u201d himself.\n\nAnd not much has changed since Cobain knocked on the station\u2019s door back in 1988. KEXP continues to champion the underground sounds they truly care about, helping catapult the careers of up-and-coming musicians, and artists and labels continue to deliver physical copies of their work \u2014 most of which eventually land in KEXP\u2019s music library, dubbed \u201cthe heart of the station\u201d by iSchool graduate and KEXP librarian Dylan Flesch, \u201908, \u201914.\n\nThe curated library houses more than 40,000 CDs and 10,000 LPs across rows and rows of shelves, and as the station\u2019s first official keeper of them, Flesch is charged with a daunting task: keeping up with the ever-growing collection that\u2019s at risk due to the simple nature of format \u2014 and playback equipment \u2014 obsolescence.\n\nTake Pinwheel (Death Cab for Cutie frontman Ben Gibbard\u2019s 90s punk project), for example, who did a live performance for KEXP 20 years ago that was captured on a digital audio tape. If digital audio tape recordings like that \u2014 which only exist in physical form \u2014 aren\u2019t ripped to a hard drive soon, they could be lost history.\n\nFlesch\u2019s love for analog media traces back to his youth \u2014 he spent every Tuesday of his teenage years browsing new releases at the local record store in his hometown of Tukwila, Washington, and stocked the shelves as a bookseller at Seattle\u2019s Elliott Bay Book Company. For the self-proclaimed \u201corganization nerd,\u201d who earned his bachelor\u2019s in business administration from UW Tacoma, the decision to combine his two passions \u2014 music and information \u2014 was an easy one.\n\nHe got a gig at KEXP as an information intern, and started a masters program in library and information science at the UW\u2019s iSchool.\n\n\u201cThe iSchool was definitely the best educational experience I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d says Flesch. \u201cI was able to combine a lot of my personal and professional interests with the classes I was taking. I could approach my professors and say \u2018Instead of this exact project outline you want us to follow, could I tweak it in a way that works better for this project I\u2019m working on at KEXP?\u2019 and get that real-world problem-solving experience, and they were more than open to that.\u201d\n<div align=\"center\"><\/div>\nIt was that real-world problem-solving experience that led him to his job. Before his iSchool capstone project \u2014 an outline of how information would be organized in the station\u2019s new media asset management system \u2014\u00a0was even over, he\u2019d been hired on by KEXP to do the work as a contract employee. Nearly two years and a handful of job titles later \u2014 production volunteer, DJ assistant, licensing and podcasting coordinator \u2014 he\u2019s found his sweet spot as librarian.\n\n\u201cBeing able to deal with changing technology is something I got out of my education at the UW, and has really given me the capacity and toolkit to deal with whatever comes my way,\u201d says Flesch. \u201cThat made me a great fit here at KEXP, and knowing I have a tiny part in preserving KEXP history and sharing it with people all over the world is one of the most exciting and rewarding things about my job.\u201d\n<h2>A new home<\/h2>\nA new chapter in the station\u2019s storied history starts in December, when the listener-powered KEXP moves just down the street to its new Seattle Center location.

Many of these workers were new to industrial work, often living in trailer camps and crowded, unsanitary living quarters. War industries more than doubled the number of nurses needed to care for industrial employees. Hospitals saw a huge influx of new patients. Meanwhile, the thousands of healthcare professionals who joined the military to aid the war effort abroad left perilous vacancies all over the United States, and hospitals began closing entire wards and departments.\n\nTo fill those vacancies, the US Federal Government established the Cadet Nurse Corps in 1943 so that civilians and nursing students could be trained to work in hospitals and clinics until the medical force returned home. All state-accredited schools of nursing were eligible to participate in the Corps if they agreed to accelerate their programs and arrange for senior cadets to complete a residency in their home hospital, a state or federal hospital, or other public health service facility. For students at the University of Washington School of Nursing, that meant spending many years at Harborview Hall, first as a student, and then as a cadet.\n\nNursing visionary Dean Elizabeth Sterling Soule made sure the UW School of Nursing was approved by the Cadet Nurse Corps Program. While the primary purpose of the Cadet Nurse Corps was to address the healthcare shortage, Soule understood that this was a pivotal moment in nursing history. For the first time, undergraduate nursing students could receive federal funding for their education.\n\nIn a book about nursing at home during World War II, professor emeritus and class of \u201947 graduate Doris Carnivali wrote: \u201cBecause Seattle was close to Japan (relatively speaking), Boeing was sited here, and the Bremerton ship yards were close by, the threat of being bombed felt very real.\u201d\n\nPerhaps that feeling of looming threat inspired the students of the UW School of Nursing Seattle to join the Cadets. In Pat Ross\u2019 class, the Basic 27\u2019s, all but one joined the Cadets. Some were still teenagers when they began caring for the sick and wounded at Harborview Hospital in 1943. Many Basic 27\u2019s started their schooling back in 1941, but did not graduate until 1947, when the nursing crisis was declared over.\n\n\u201cIf the war hadn\u2019t ended, we\u2019d all have gone right into military nursing,\u201d said Betty Bemis (nee Hill), BSN \u201947.\n\nRoss was just 20 years old when she joined the Nurse Cadets and began giving full-time care to the sick and wounded at Harborview Hospital.\n\n\u201cThe heartache\u2014oh my God. One young man, at 17, set out from Alabama. He was supposed to be shipped out but ended up with leukemia at Harborview. I was at his bedside when his mother called, I held his hand for 27 hours. My friends took my shifts so I could stay with him.\u201d\n\nCadet nurses were not permitted to marry during their service, though many had boyfriends fighting in the war.\n\nIn a cruel twist of fate, a polio epidemic struck Seattle during the Cadet Corps service. Ross recalls the chaos of the time.\n\n\u201cThis poor young intern came in [to the polio area] to do a spinal tap and he couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d she said. \"I said, 'just give me the needle!' He was shipped off the next day.\u201d\n\nBemis estimated seeing at least 10 patients a day on her own; Ross remembers 12 hour work days. Supplies, like linens, were scarce. In the heyday of the war, the former Ephrata High School valedictorian and cheerleader remembers offering mostly comfort \u2014 back rubs, baths.\n\nDespite it all, the cadets had fun. Ross and a tiny group she called \u201cthe Evil Eight\u201d snuck through the underground hallways of Harborview to go out and have the occasional beer. \u201cIt\u2019s how we stayed alive,\u201d she said. \u00a0And in 1945, the nursing students (most of whom were serving in the Corps) put together the inaugural yearbook, <em>Capsule<\/em>. Dean Soule, referred to as the \u201cFirst lady of nursing at the University of Washington,\u201d writes on the first page:\n\n\u201cBecause we are at war, you are having your work in the most critical period nursing has ever known. You have the satisfaction of knowing that you are vital war work and at the same time having the real joy of helping people when they need it most.\u201d\n\nWhen the war officially ended in 1945, Cadets were providing 80 percent of the nursing care in more than 1,000 civilian hospitals. The Corps trained 124,000 nurses in less than five years, which made it the largest successful training program in the Unites States at the time. But more importantly, as Dean Soule predicted, it changed the way nurses were educated.\n\nDean Soule had already begun advocating and implementing a more academic approach to nursing education in lieu of the traditional apprenticeship. She saw that the Corps would complement her curricular changes.\n\nCadet nursing helped heal an aching nation while ushering in the beginning of a more modern, intensive, science focused nursing education\u2014one in which \u00a0the UW would go on to lead."},{"title":"Science takes center stage in \"Thought Experiments\"","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/science-takes-center-stage-in-thought-experiments\/","tags":["alumni","arts-sciences","faculty"],"pillars":["innovation"],"image":"","excerpt":"Playwrights and scientists pair up to explore what it means to be human in light of current developments in science and technology.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, September 2015)\n\nHolly Arsenault loves a challenge.

It doesn\u2019t matter. We can use all the offerings of the modern world to help us make global connections.\u201d\n<div>\n<h3>\u201cWe can be in China, in Egypt, in Peru or in a classroom in Seattle\u2026<\/h3>\n<\/div>\nValdez\u2019s class\u2014From the Andes to the Cascades along the Pacific Coast: Environmental issues in Peru and the Pacific Northwest\u2014was taught in spring 2015 as an advanced seminar for 10 Bothell students. Valdez designed the class as a collaborative international learning experience, partnering with Dr. Armando Valdes-Velasquez, who taught a parallel class for his 20 students at Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia in the capital city of Lima. Both classes were taught in English.\n\n\u201cCollaborating with the Peruvian students online was an amazing opportunity that challenged my communication skills and significantly helped to prepare me for working with colleagues internationally,\u201d says Kramer Canup, a UW Bothell student.\n\n\u201cThis was an experience that made me realize how small I am in this world,\u201d says fellow student Kanwal Yousuf, \u201cyet there is so much one person can do to make a difference.\u201d\n<h3><strong>Creating a study abroad experience without leaving home<\/strong><\/h3>\nTo make the class a success, Valdez knew she needed students in her classroom and in Peru to engage in deep discussions on environmental issues that affect both their countries. And they had to interact and collaborate with one another to find potential solutions.\n\nValdez, who received her PhD in biology from UW, and her Peruvian colleague relied on social media tools that are ubiquitous around the globe to bring their classes together. They used Skype to create a single virtual classroom, allowing the students in both countries to make voice calls, chat and message, and also to conduct live video conferences over the Internet. These sessions brought the parallel classes together as one, even as they were being held concurrently 5,000 miles apart.\n\nTo encourage and enrich further interactions among students outside the classroom, Valdez asked students to use social media tools such as Facebook and WhatsApp, a free instant messaging app for smartphones, which allowed students to talk to one another inside and outside the classroom.\n\nThere were communication challenges, for sure, but the efforts paid off in huge ways, says Peruvian co-lecturer Valdes-Velasquez.\n\n\u201cDesigning and developing a course that took into account two distinct realities and two languages was a huge challenge,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd one of the most rewarding initiatives I have been involved in.\u201d\n<h3><strong>Globally networked learning is possible<\/strong><\/h3>\nThe seeds for Valdez\u2019s class were planted a year ago, when she attended a UW Bothell Global Initiatives seminar and heard about the Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) Fellows program.\n\nThe fellowship supports UW faculty and staff from all campuses in developing multicultural learning environments that link UW classes to those at other universities across the globe. Instructors use various communication technologies to engage students from different countries, with lecturers from each country co-teaching and managing course work.\n<div>\n<h3>\u201c\u2026to create an international and intercultural learning community that broke boundaries.<\/h3>\n<\/div>\nWith COIL, Valdez saw an opportunity. \u201cI kept thinking about how I could bring some of these experiences from my native Peru to my students in Bothell. But I was also thinking about how I could bring the rich history and biodiversity of the Northwest to Peruvian students,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to create an international and intercultural learning community that broke boundaries.\u201d\n\nValdez received a COIL fellowship to develop a collaborative international teaching and learning experience that focused on biodiversity, climate change and other important issues that face the Northwest and Peru. With assistance from Valdes-Velasquez, she spent several months designing her course.\n\n\u201cIt was not difficult to find parallels between the two countries,\u201d Valdez says. \u201cArmando and I wanted students from each country to relate to each other\u2019s problems.\u201d\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<h2 id=\"fivetips\">Valdez\u2019s six suggestions for creating parallel classes<\/h2>\n<h3>1. Find a committed teaching partner and connect with UW resources for support<\/h3>\nSupport is available for UW faculty and staff who want to pursue teaching globally. The Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) Fellows program can guide you on how to successfully carry out globally networked learning, from finding a faculty partner to gathering institutional support and negotiating course content with your teaching partner. Demonstrating her commitment to co-teaching, Valdez used her fellowship funds to bring Valdes-Velasquez to Bothell to help lead classroom discussions for a week, and she traveled to Peru to teach in his class as well. While having global connections was certainly helpful to Valdez\u2014who grew up and studied in Peru and continues to teach there\u2014they are not required.\n<h3>2. <strong>Apply to be a UW COIL Fellow<\/strong><\/h3>\nUW faculty from all three campuses are encouraged to apply for the 2015-16 cohort of UW Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) Fellows. Successful applicants will receive $2,000 in funding and individualized support to implement an international collaboration course.\n<h3>3. Focus tightly on engaging topics that cut across borders<\/h3>\nFinding areas of common interest to students in both countries is one of the most important components of any co-taught international class, Valdez says. Working together, Valdez and her teaching partner settled on four major topics for discussion that had parallels in both countries: biodiversity and iconic species of the Pacific Northwest and Peru; use of forest resources and the impact of human activities on habitat loss, conservation and the economy; mountain ecology and climate change; and fisheries and conservation.\n<h3>4. Collaboration leads to higher engagement<\/h3>\nInteraction and collaboration with Peruvian students was highly motivating for her class, Valdez says. It led to higher engagement with class materials and better learning outcomes.\n\n\u201cYou begin to see things you didn\u2019t see through the eyes of someone who may live in a very different society compared to yours,\u201d says Yousuf, of UW Bothell. \u201cYou get to compare issues that happen around your area to issues that are happening around the world. I learned a lot about why our ecosystem is so important, but most importantly I learned why collaborating and researching with other people from other parts of the world is so important.\u201d\n\nCanup, a fellow student, agreed. \u201cIt was a truly unique interdisciplinary experience, with a diverse class structure that always kept me engaged and excited, as the class combined group discussions with students abroad, and outdoor workshops and field trips with professional conservation biologists.\u201d\n<h3>5. Social media is your friend<\/h3>\nThere are many ways to communicate across the globe but Valdez settled on Skype, both for its large number of communication features and because it is readily accessible to Peruvians.\n\nSo is Facebook, and Valdez decided to create a private group to allow students to share information outside the classroom.\n\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em\">COIL facilitator Greg Tuke was impressed by the use of Facebook. \u201cIt was so clear to me when I read the student Facebook exchanges that they were connecting with each other both from the head and the heart.\u201d<\/span>\u201cI never imagined that Facebook would have been such a powerful tool for learning,\u201d says Valdez, who posted often to encourage students to discuss issues.\n\n\u201cAnyone can research, then compare and contrast bioregions of the world,\u201d Tuke says. \u201cThe information is easy to access. But as these students learned about their local bioregions and how it impacted people they now were getting to know, students started gathering and posting additional information to benefit each other, not just to get a better grade. That is motivated learning at its best.\u201d\n\nValdez also created a blog for students to share their ideas, and during field trips to Mount Rainier and other Cascade Mountains destinations, she encouraged them to make <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/trends\/valdez-classroom-without-borders\/#videoplaylist\">short videos<\/a> that could be shared with their Peruvian counterparts.\n\nThis diverse array of communication tools made it easier for students to exchange ideas inside and outside the classroom.\n\n\u201cYes, there were language barriers, technical barriers, but students felt empowered,\u201d says Valdez. \u201cThey could talk to one another, exchange ideas and have lively discussions. We used everything we had at our disposal to help them learn together.\u201d\n<h3>6. Move students to action<\/h3>\nValdez wanted her students to understand that research for research\u2019s sake is not enough. She wanted students to take action that would encourage real change. So, students were asked to write articles and letters to editors and politicians to bring attention to environmental issues. At Bothell, students assembled a display table at the center of campus with information on protecting water quality in Puget Sound, and asked fellow students to sign a petition.\n\nBeyond moving students to action, the joint classes showed the incredible potential of connecting students around the world.The Peruvians took similar actions back in Lima. \u201cWe were able to do concrete things to solve problems such as writing letters to various authorities, whether the head of state, ministry of environment or fishery, and letters to the editor in magazines,\u201d Peruvian student Romina Najarro says. \u201cIt was rewarding to have new ideas for problem solving, as well as cultural exchange among students.\u201d\n\n\u201cWatching my students explore the similarities between the past and current issues in Washington and Peru, engage in heated discussions with their US counterparts, and work jointly to come up with great presentations and great work has led me to believe that the skills to work internationally should be an intrinsic part of our career programs,\u201d Valdes-Velasquez says. \u201cIt creates new and enriching opportunities for students and, most importantly, helps create a new kind of professional capable of generating global initiatives and answers to today\u2019s problems.\u201d\n<h2 class=\"widgettitle\">WHAT STUDENTS SAID<\/h2>\n<div class=\"textwidget\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/trends\/files\/2015\/09\/kanwal-yousuf.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"70\" height=\"70\" \/>\u201cI learned why collaborating and researching with other people from other parts of the world is so important...\u201d\n\u2014Kanwal Yousuf, UW Bothell student\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/trends\/files\/2015\/09\/romina-najarro.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"70\" height=\"70\" \/>\u201cIt was rewarding to have new ideas for problem solving, as well as cultural exchange among students...\"\n\u2014Romina Najarro,\u00a0Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia student\n\n<\/div>"},{"title":"A sergeant works toward a UW degree \u2014 in Korea","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/a-sergeant-works-toward-a-uw-degree-in-korea\/","tags":["arts-sciences","global","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"The UW's Integrated Social Sciences degree program allows students to take courses anywhere\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including active-duty military stationed abroad.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, November 2015)\n\nIt\u2019s 8 pm. Sergeant Christopher Land opens his laptop in a quiet corner of his off-base apartment near Camp Humphreys in South Korea. He\u2019s been up since 5:30 am, first completing a required workout, then supervising soldiers as they rebuild helicopter engines. After dinner with his family and a bath for his five-month-old daughter, he finally has time to complete research for his social science theory class.\n\nLand is a UW undergraduate, pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree through the University\u2019s new online Integrated Social Sciences (ISS) degree program. The online program, based in the College of Arts and Sciences, makes it possible for non-traditional students like Land to earn a degree, taking classes from the same top faculty as students on campus.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s military, even as an enlisted soldier, most people recognize that greater civilian education leads to a more successful military career,\u201d says Land. \u201cWhile many commanders and senior leaders support soldiers going to college, for the most part the mission doesn\u2019t allow you to complete your degree during the day. So the flexibility of the program is extremely important.\u201d\n\nISS was\u00a0launched in autumn 2014 as a way for the UW to open its doors to people who are space-bound, time-bound, or work-bound. Students enter the program with two or more years of college behind them and a desire to complete a bachelor\u2019s degree. About 260 students are currently enrolled in the program, including quite a few military personnel, family of military personnel, and veterans. About 85 percent of ISS students are from Washington state.\n\nISS courses should not be confused with the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) offered by many universities. Like MOOCs, ISS lectures are recorded so that students may view them at their convenience, speeding them up, slowing them down, and re-watching them as needed. But unlike MOOCs, ISS courses are part of a carefully constructed degree program with five core courses and dozens of upper-level electives. The program culminates with a capstone project in which students curate their best work\u2014learning plans, articles, self-reflection essays, maps, and other materials\u2014organizing them in an electronic portfolio that showcases their learning and achievements.\n<div class=\"entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-block-full-width-element\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"quote-border top\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"quote-border bottom\">Along the way, students work closely with an academic adviser to navigate ISS\u2019s many options. \u201cWe encourage students to reflect on the courses they plan to take, the courses they\u2019ve already taken, what they\u2019ve learned, and what it has to do with anything else in their lives,\u201d says Mel Wensel, director of academic services for ISS. \u201cWe don\u2019t sit passively and wait for them to contact us. We actively monitor and make sure they are making good academic progress, and reach out to support anybody who looks like they might be faltering or experiencing challenges. We also keep up with their successes and celebrate those.\u201d<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\nThe monitoring is made easier by Canvas, a learning management system through which faculty deliver lectures, assignments, and quizzes. Canvas also features discussion boards and makes possible collaborative work and peer review. Faculty and advisers stay in touch with students in other ways as well. \u201cThere are a lot of emails between students and advisers, and students and instructors,\u201d says Wensel. \u201cAnd we maintain an ISS Facebook page, where students are able to communicate a little less formally.\u201d\n<div class=\"entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-block-full-width-element\"><\/div>\nChris Land says the Facebook page helps him feel connected despite being half a world away. \u201cPeople share common issues or interesting articles related to our studies in the social sciences, or they just jump on to say \u2018Go Dawgs!\u2019 on game day,\u201d he says of the site. \u201cThat, along with the UW\u2019s strong social media presence, makes me feel like I am back in Washington and a part of the community.\u201d\n\nLand also sings the praises of the program\u2019s advisers and faculty, describing them as \u201cimmensely helpful, very supportive, and extremely accessible.\u201d\u00a0 Matt Sparke, professor of international studies and geography and director of ISS, explains that some faculty joined the program to be part of an innovative new venture while others welcomed the opportunity to reach an adult population of underserved students. For both groups, the experience has exceeded their expectations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think many of the faculty fully anticipated the enjoyment of teaching online and the thrill of seeing how rich the student-faculty exchanges are,\u201d says Sparke. \u201cFaculty have spontaneously contacted us to say, \u2018This is amazing. I know what my students are thinking. When I was in a large lecture hall, I <em>thought<\/em> I knew what they were thinking, but I didn\u2019t have this clear and constant sense of it.\u2019 That was really eye-opening for them.\u201d\n\nSparke is quick to point out that the campus classroom and the online experience each have their own strengths. \u201cThere is magic in the lecture hall,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to deny that. There are moments of connection when students\u2019 minds are really set on fire by new ideas. But I think there\u2019s equally a kind of magic that happens in the online teaching space. You have people with really interesting real-world experiences to bring to those discussions. We\u2019ve got people coming to an online class from Korea and Cuba and Europe, and from different parts of Washington state, including two tribal students joining us this year. That brings so much diversity to the conversation.\u201d\n\nNext month, 17 students from the program\u2019s first entering class will graduate. Others will take a little longer, having arrived with fewer credits or competing commitments. ISS offers the option to take a quarter off as needed, as a student in the Army Reserve did when he was deployed last winter.\n\nThat flexibility, so appealing to students, makes budgetary planning a challenge for the self-sustaining program. But Sparke remains undaunted, and eager to watch the program mature.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exhilarating to be part of this,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s allowed so many of us to see the UW in genuinely boundless ways.\u201d\n\n<em>For more about the Integrated Social Sciences program, visit <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.socialsciencesonline.uw.edu\/\"><em>www.socialsciencesonline.uw.edu<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em>"},{"title":"Military fellow embraces UW experience","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/military-fellow-embraces-uw-experience\/","tags":["arts-sciences","graduate-student","tacoma"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"A new Asia-Pacific Military Fellowship in the Jackson School provides immersion in the history and culture of Asian countries.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, November 2015)\n\nLieutenant Colonel Jaren Price\u2019s 20-year military career reads like a world atlas. He\u2019s been a platoon leader in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a logistics officer in Germany, an intelligence officer in Serbia, Kuwait, and Iraq, and an operations officer in South Korea. Stateside, he\u2019s had assignments in Kansas, Arizona, and Kentucky. Now he\u2019s in the best place of all--the Puget Sound region (of course)\u2014as the UW\u2019s first-ever Asia-Pacific Military Fellow.\n<div class=\"fig-fix-wrap right\"><\/div>\nThe fellowship, based in the Jackson School of International Studies (JSIS) and funded by the Army, is a partnership between the University of Washington, the Army War College,\u00a0and Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM). Fellows spend a year at the UW studying the politics, history, and culture of one or more countries in the Pacific.\n\n\u201cOur interactions with other nations are, at their heart, visceral and\u00a0human,\u201d explains Major General William Hix, director of strategies, plans, and policy for the Army. \u201cIf you don\u2019t understand the human aspects\u2014the culture, the politics\u2014everything else may be irrelevant. Having an understanding of how other people think is important. When Jaren heads back to the Pacific next year, he will be able to help senior leaders make better informed decisions and implement things in a more effective manner because of the time he spent at the University of Washington.\u201d\n\nThe military has a long tradition of educational fellowships. \u00a0Most participating institutions have been located on the East Coast or abroad; the UW is only the\u00a0second university on the West Coast with such a\u00a0fellowship, joining Stanford University.\n\nThe fellowship grew out of a conversation between JSIS Director Re\u015fat Kasaba and Lieutenant General Stephen R. Lanza, Commanding General of I Corps, headquartered at JBLM in Tacoma. \u201cStephen told me that the Joint Base is going to be central as the U.S. government pivots toward China and the Pacific Rim, and that it is important for officers to know about Asia,\u201d Kasaba recalls. \u201cGiven the strength of the Jackson School, he thought it would be great if we could create a fellowship program here.\u201d UW Tacoma, which has close ties with JBLM, is also part of the collaboration.\n<div class=\"fig-fix-wrap left\"><\/div>\nDuring his fellowship year, Price will enroll in six UW courses, speak to other classes, complete a year-long research project, and travel to Washington, DC to brief Congressional staff about his research. The focus of the research is recent changes in Japan security legislation that may significantly increase Japan\u2019s military capabilities. Price is exploring how those changes might affect stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the role of the U.S. military in that region.\n\nSaadia Pekkanen, Gertrud Tamaki Professor in the Jackson School, is Price\u2019s mentor for the year, meeting with him weekly to discuss his research and to guide him toward UW resources. \u201cIt\u2019s a two-way exchange,\u201d says Pekkanen. \u201cI\u2019m able to offer the historical and cultural context, and Jaren knows about the region from an operational point of view. It\u2019s really wonderful to engage with him on that level. It really expands my frontiers, to think about what policy changes mean operationally on the ground.\u201d\n\nPrice looks forward to using his newfound knowledge on his next military assignment in 2016. But for now he\u2019s enjoying the Pacific Northwest and the academic immersion his fellowship provides.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the military and you\u2019re around people who do the same kind of work that you do, a lot of times you tend to think alike,\u201d says Price. \u201cAt the UW, people have very different perspectives on security, on Asia, on international relations. Just being able to listen and participate in the conversations in class is really enlightening. Beyond that, there are so many things going on at the University. Whether it\u2019s a guest lecturer coming to the Jackson School or an ambassador coming in or all the arts events on campus, the UW has fantastic resources. My next assignment should be in the Asia-Pacific region, so I look forward to applying what I\u2019m learning here.

The students come from the Warrior Transition Battalion at Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM), a battalion of injured soldiers transitioning to civilian life. \u201cWe are basically part of their medical therapy,\u201d says Wong. \u201cIt\u2019s writing therapy. I often say that I\u2019m practicing medicine without a license.\u201d\n\nHaving taught creative writing at the UW for more than three decades, Wong assumed he could use the same teaching approach with the soldiers. He quickly discovered otherwise. \u201cEvery one of the soldiers is angry, from really angry to pretty angry,\u201d says Wong. \u201cThey have experienced a lot of trauma and the trauma is very recent. So while in my UW classes I rarely talk about myself and what I\u2019ve been through in my life, in these classes I talk about the traumas in my own life and how I\u2019ve dealt with them. They listen very intently.\u201d\n\nAs a non-veteran, Wong initially worried how he would be received by the soldiers. To his surprise, they like the fact that he is a civilian, particularly since they are transitioning to civilian life. And because nothing from class ends up in their Army record, they feel comfortable speaking freely. \u201cWe don\u2019t ask them to write about anything in particular,\u201d says Wong. \u201cWe don\u2019t ask them to write about combat or trauma. I\u2019ll put out a writing prompt, and it\u2019s up to them to decide what to write about. The thing that impresses me is how honest everybody is in what they put down on paper. Once they realize they can say and write whatever they want, they really make some progress.\u201d\n\nThat progress presents in surprising ways. Wong recalls a National Guard soldier who had suffered more than half a dozen concussions from roadside bombs and had lost motor function in his fingers. He\u2019d been a middle school teacher before deployment but was now unable to type and had trouble writing by hand. \u201cI would say he was the angriest of all the students,\u201d says Wong.\u00a0 Doctors told the soldier his injuries were likely permanent, but after taking the Red Badge Project class multiple times, he regained the ability to type and write\u2014and got his old teaching job back. \u201cBefore he left, he told us, \u2018I don\u2019t know how to say this, but you saved my life,\u2019\u201d recalls Wong. \u201cThere are moments like that when you realize the importance of what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nWong can point to other examples, including a soldier whose uncontrollable tic disappeared whenever he wrote in his class journal, or a soldier who was silent and aloof in class for days until one day he shared a story that was immensely personal and heartbreaking. \u201cOne of the things the soldiers have told us over the years is that they find our classes safe,\u201d says Wong. \u201cThey realize it\u2019s a safe place.\u201d\n<div class=\"fig-fix-wrap left\">Since launching in 2011, the Red Badge Project has expanded to include a Women\u2019s Group led by writer Sonja Lea, and a class in Walla Walla made possible through funds raised by the Walla Walla Veterans Center. The Walla Walla class is taught by local college faculty, trained by Wong and other Red Badge Project volunteers.<\/div>\nWong has found the Red Badge Project to be more satisfying than he ever imagined. \u201cEvery time I\u2019m in class I learn something new,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t hear the soldiers\u2019 stories and not be affected by them. In the beginning, I didn\u2019t know what to do with those stories. I carried around that weight. I\u2019d wake up at night, worrying about the soldiers. But as I became more confident with my teaching and I could see that I was helping them, that made it better. It\u2019s the most challenging teaching I\u2019ve ever done, but also the most rewarding.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line, says Wong, is that the soldiers now feel free to tell their stories. \u201cWhile they can\u2019t always control what happens to them, they can control the <em>message<\/em> of what happens to them,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd that\u2019s probably more important than anything else.\u201d\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">.\u00a0\u00a0 .\u00a0\u00a0 .<\/p>\n<em>For more about the Red Badge Project, visit <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/theredbadgeproject.org\/\"><em>theredbadgeproject.org<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em>"},{"title":"Undergraduate researchers find the UW to be an awesome \"summer camp\"","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/undergraduate-researchers-find-the-uw-to-be-an-awesome-summer-camp\/","tags":["arts-sciences","comotion","undergraduate-student","medicine"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Each\u00a0summer, more than 120 undergraduates bring\u00a0their innovation mindsets and drive to discover to faculty research projects across campus.","content":"(Undergraduate Academic Affairs, August 2015)\n\nEach summer, when campus is quieter and Mt. Rainier is out more often, undergraduates from the University of Washington and from universities across the country participate in the UW version of a wonderful childhood tradition: summer camp. The UW, however, is quite a bit techier than the thin-walled, mossy-roofed cabins of yore.\n\nHere, the hum, buzz and whir of high tech lab equipment replaces the song of the mosquito; lab coats are worn instead of polar fleece; and student researchers\u2019 \u201ccamp counselors\u201d are faculty members whose interests push the boundaries of innovation and contribute to a world of good.This summer, more than 120 undergraduates brought their innovation mindsets and drive to discover to faculty research projects across campus. The projects varied from understanding pain to better alleviate it, to photonics, genome sciences, engineering and more.\n<h3>New programs bring new opportunities for undergraduates<\/h3>\nOf particular note is a new program in which undergraduate researchers are better understanding and contributing to the alleviation of pain. Millions of people in the US alone suffer from debilitating chronic pain. In the new Innovations in Pain Research Summer Program, students work alongside doctors and researchers from UW Medicine to better understand pain and treatment mechanisms, develop new therapies and improve access to evidence-based pain care.\n\nRising senior Alta Steward worked with Dr. Kushang V. Patel from the Department of Anesthesiology conducting epidemiology research with an emphasis on chronic pain and cellular aging. \u201cMany older people suffer from chronic pain, and chronic pain has been linked to early death,\u201d explains Stewart. \u201cBy looking at the relationship between cellular age and pain, we hope to shed light on what factors lead to earlier death and what can be done to combat these.\u201d\n\nThis project is the first research project Stewart, a mathematics and neurobiology double-major, has worked on. She \u201chad no idea what to expect going into this experience and had never even thought of doing epidemiology research before. I realized within the first week that this was a really great fit for me and I am thrilled to be able to continue this research in the coming year.\u201d\n\nTom Gebert, a rising senior in neurobiology, researched different aspects of pain in children. In one study, he and his fellow researchers \u201canalyzed a national database to study pediatric pain patients and subsequent development of psychiatric disorders in adulthood.\u201d In the project he\u2019ll present at the August 19 symposium, the team studied trends in opiod prescriptions in children, adolescents and their family members over 15 years. Given the high potential for misusing opiod prescriptions, results from this study could guide future studies and clinical practices around opiod use.\n\nEven though Gebert has participated in undergraduate research for two years, he says that this summer\u2019s projects have been \u201can incredible experience to be able to peek further into the world of academic research, and it is encouraging to see that with enough passion and drive there are opportunities to pursue just about any intellectual curiosity.\u201d\n\nThe Innovations in Pain Research project is funded by a gift from Scan Design to the Department of Anesthesiology, which, in turn, is collaborating with the Undergraduate Research Program.\n\nAnother new opportunity for undergraduates is a collaboration with the UW\u2019s CoMotion. Students in the CoMotion Mary Gates Innovation Scholars program spent the summer interning with faculty-led initiatives to create real-world impact from University research. Students work alongside UW teams in bringing discoveries to the marketplace and extend their classroom-based work into the realms of innovation and entrepreneurship.\n<h3>Undergraduate research opportunities abound in the summer<\/h3>\nIn addition to these research opportunities, students are making advances in faculty-led research in organic chemistry, materials science and engineering, physics, electrical engineering, chemical synthesis, and more. Undergraduates are finding research opportunities in such programs as <a href=\"mailto:http:\/\/www.hookedonphotonics.org\">Hooked on Photonics<\/a>, the <a href=\"mailto:http:\/\/www.hhmi.org\/grants\/individuals\/exrop.html\">Howard Hughes Medical Institute Exceptional Research Opportunities Program<\/a>, and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nsf-cchf.com\/\">Center for Selective C-H Functionalization<\/a> as well as others across campus.\n\nThe Undergraduate Research Program supports students in these summer research programs through advising, by building a community of researchers, and facilitating the application process to connect students and faculty researchers.\n\n&nbsp;"},{"title":"Picturing hope","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/picturing-hope\/","tags":["alumni","college-of-education","giving"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"With a deep background in special education, UW graduate Ariane Gauvreau works to make the future brighter for children with special needs \u2014 and their families.","content":"(Homepage, November 2015)\n\nIn a preschool classroom, a teacher snaps a photo of a young girl stacking colorful wooden blocks, her face focused in concentration.

With the goal of improving communication, parents use the photos as visual aids to guide nightly conversations with their children. And the initial results of the study are impressive.\n\n\u201cAfter working with these visual supports for a couple of months, the kids were able to add in detail and have higher quality conversations with their parents, even without the support of the photos,\u201d says Gauvreau.\n\nThe <a href=\"http:\/\/haringcenter.org\/eeu\/\">Haring Center\u2019s Experimental Education Unit<\/a> (EEU) was where Gauvreau began to see, as an undergraduate classroom aide, how she could make a difference, from testing new theories to working with children every day. \u201cThe teachers there were innovative and creative, and they changed the way I thought about what I could do as an educator,\u201d she says.Finding innovative ways to improve communication and overall development for children with disabilities \u2014 and give their parents the tools and support they need \u2014 is a thread that has long run through Gauvreau\u2019s work at the UW. For over a decade, she was deeply involved in the <a href=\"http:\/\/haringcenter.org\/\">UW\u2019s Haring Center for Research and Training in Inclusive Education<\/a>, where she connected educational theory with tangible, hands-on experience working with young children.\n\nYears later, she became the head teacher of the EEU\u2019s Project DATA (Developmentally Appropriate Treatment for Autism), a program that combines a focus on individualized instruction with an integrated classroom experience. \u201cIt is a really lovely combination of the two,\u201d says Gauvreau. \u201cKids get the individualized instruction they really need to be successful, but they also get to attend preschool every day with their friends who don\u2019t have disabilities.\u201d\n\nToday, Gauvreau remains focused on teaching and research at the UW. As the lead coach for the <a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/programs\/graduate\/special-education\">College of Education\u2019s Special Education graduate program<\/a>, she\u2019s helping prepare pre-service special education teachers for their future classrooms. \u201cI love helping shape their beliefs and philosophies in the way that my teachers and mentors here at the UW have shaped mine,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd, through ongoing research into tools that both help children learn and empower their families, Gauvreau hopes to continue adding more options to the educational landscape. She draws inspiration from the children and families she serves, but also from her peers.\n\n\u201cThe bar is set high at the UW, and I\u2019m constantly challenged,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone in the College of Education is working really hard to change the lives of kids and families.

He served as the first director of the EEU, and though he\u2019s now retired, his legacy continues to have a positive impact on the lives of families and young children \u2014 and the educators of the future.\n\nNorris and his wife, Dorothy, established the <a href=\"http:\/\/haringcenter.org\/give\/dorothy-and-norris-haring-endowed-fellowship\/\">Dorothy and Norris Haring Endowed Fellowship<\/a>, and it\u2019s fitting that Gauvreau received it as a Ph.D. student.\n\n\u201cHaving that funding enabled me to do this study exploring photos and parent communication,\u201d says Gauvreau. \u201cAnd, with Norris\u2019 impact on the field of special education, it was an honor to have a fellowship with his name.\u201d\n<h2>Triple Dawg<\/h2>\nIn addition to holding three degrees from the UW, Gauvreau has deep experience working in special education at the University.\n<ul>\n\t<li>Ph.D., Education, \u201915<\/li>\n\t<li>M.Ed., Special Education, \u201908<\/li>\n\t<li>B.A., Psychology, \u201905<\/li>\n\t<li>Teaching Associate and Lead Coach, UW College of Education, Aug. 2015\u2013Present<\/li>\n\t<li>Assessment Coordinator and Team Leader, UW College of Education, 2011\u2013Present<\/li>\n\t<li>Practicum Supervisor, UW College of Education, 2011\u201315<\/li>\n\t<li>Instructor, UW College of Education 2011\u201315<\/li>\n\t<li>Project DATA Head Teacher, Haring Center, 2007\u201311<\/li>\n\t<li>Classroom Aide, Haring Center, 2002\u00ad\u201307<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n&nbsp;"},{"title":"Monkeying around in remote Indonesia","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/monkeying-around-in-remote-indonesia\/","tags":["alumni","arts-sciences","faculty","global","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"For 20 years, UW students have participated in field research on a tropical\u00a0island that's home to more than a thousand monkeys.","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, September 2015)\n\nWhen Matthew Novak set foot on Tinjil Island in Indonesia this summer, it was a homecoming of sorts. Twenty years ago, Novak (B.S., Ph.D., Psychology, 1993, 2002) participated in a month-long field study program on the remote island as a UW graduate student. He returned this year as a professor, along with four of his Central Oregon Community College students.\n\n\u201cI suppose Matt\u2019s students are my grandstudents,\u201d jokes Randy Kyes, research professor in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.psych.uw.edu\/\">UW Department of Psychology<\/a>, core scientist in the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.wanprc.org\/\">UW Primate Center<\/a>,\u00a0and director of the <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/cgfs\/\">UW Center for Global Field Study<\/a>. Kyes led the field study program when Novak was a graduate student and continues to lead it today.\u00a0 The program focuses on conservation biology and global health,\u00a0and is open to anyone interested in field research.\n\nTinjil Island is home to more than 1,500 long-tailed macaque monkeys, as well as monitor lizards and many other tropical fauna and flora. Kyes began leading a summer field training program there for Indonesian students in 1991, through a collaboration between the UW Primate Center and Bogor Agricultural University\u2019s Primate Center. Five years in, he realized that adding UW students would enrich the experience for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of opportunity I would have liked when I was a student,\u201d he says.\u00a0 He and his Indonesian colleagues offer the program annually, with about six U.S. students and up to a dozen students from Indonesia and other countries participating.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a very remote area, in an environment that\u2019s demanding and a bit of a hardship,\u201d says Kyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a particular kind of student who wants to venture out and do that for a month, so we\u2019re never looking at huge numbers of students\u2014which is good, because we can\u2019t take that many into a setting like that.\u201d\n\nNovak was in the first UW cohort, in 1995. \u201cI was one of Randy\u2019s guinea pigs to figure out how to get American students to Tinjil,\u201d he recalls. \u201cNow he has a system in place that paces the students through the various challenges of the field study \u2018lifestyle.\u2019 It is truly impressive to watch. I am aware of other programs around the world and am fairly certain that Randy has the best program for field study training anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nFor UW participants, most of whom are undergraduates, the program actually begins months before their arrival in Indonesia. They take a preparatory spring quarter course to learn some Indonesian language and develop a proposal for their individual research project. By the time they reach Tinjil, they have a plan for collecting data and are ready to dive in.\n\nThen reality hits.\n\n\u201cI always warn students that nothing will go the way they think it will,\u201d says Kyes. \u201cThat\u2019s just the nature of field research. I also tell them not to worry if the research fails. This is about training, about the learning experience, not about doing your final dissertation.\u201d Despite Kyes\u2019s remarks, some students become so committed to their research that they return for a second year to continue it.\n\nThe research often requires tromping through dense jungle<em>,<\/em> using machetes to clear fast-growing foliage. \u201cI had to learn to get past the bugs and the six-foot lizards and keep walking,\u201d Catherine Chu (BS, Psychology, 1999) told <em>Perspectives<\/em> after participating in the late 1990s. \u201cAnd I had to learn how to hear and see in the jungle.

This program can help them decide if field research is something they want to pursue.\u201d\n\nWhatever their decision, alumni\u2019s praise for the field study program has been unanimous.

Billo and his students leave the city behind, both its comforts and distractions, to traverse 50 miles and gain 19,000 feet of vertical distance over nine days in Washington\u2019s rugged Olympic National Park.\n\n\u201cExperiential learning, when you directly experience the places and concepts you are studying, is such a powerful tool,\u201d Billo said. \u201cBarriers to learning that might exist in the classroom are quickly broken down.\u201d\n\nThe course uses our local wilderness as a lens to see the changes that have occurred since the last ice age and over the last 150 years of European settlement and industrialization. This year\u2019s group saw evidence that cold weather plants are inching up mountainsides in search of cooler climes and compared historical photos of glaciers in the Olympics to what they were seeing in present day (in 1980, there were 262 glaciers in the Olympic Mountains; <a href=\"http:\/\/environment.uw.edu\/news\/2015\/06\/what-does-it-take-to-catalogue-every-glacier-in-a-mountain-range\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">now there are 184<\/a>), among other things.\n\nBeyond observing the physical and biological changes to the landscape, the course creates an environment ripe for dialogue about where we\u2019re headed during this critical time in the anthropocene\u2014a geologic timeframe when human activity, for the first time, is impacting all aspects of the natural world and its processes.\n\nStudents discuss questions like, what is the value of wild places and does human recreation have a place there? Are we responsible for\u00a0preserving remaining wilderness areas? If human activities impact wild landscapes, should we take steps to mitigate? And if mitigation requires, for example, helicopter overflights, widespread culling of non-native species, or other impactful management techniques, is it possible to do so without denigrating what wilderness stands for?\n\nHaving spent little time in the wilderness, Shane Kelly, an Environmental Studies major from a small Illinois town on the Mississippi River, always thought wilderness was important for wildlife\u2014not people. His thoughts on that have changed since taking the course.\n\n\u201cThere are huge benefits for people when they interact with wilderness,\u201d Kelly\u00a0said. \u201cIt gives you an appreciation for everyday luxuries, like how much distance can be covered in a car with no physical exertion. I learned a lot about myself, too. I\u2019m capable of more than I thought.\u201d\n\nEach day\u2019s hike culminates with a student-led discussion on a topic related to landscape change under either a natural sciences or philosophy filter. Topics explored this year included the development of place attachment and land ethic through readings of classic literature, as well as Americans\u2019 evolving relationship with nature\u2014from loathing to romancing and boy scouts to \u201cleave no trace.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe physicality of the hike and the sights, sounds, and lessons learned along the way bring the group together and are a great primer for a deep, but respectful conversation about building a more sustainable society,\u201d Billo said.\n\nFor Billo and his students, the Olympic National Park is an ideal place to think about what it means that only about five percent of the entire United States\u2014an area slightly larger than the state of California\u2014is protected wilderness (and more than half of that is in Alaska). Wild landscapes, Billo says, are the last place modern humans can experience what life might have been like prior to the anthropocene.\n\n\u201cWhen we started, I didn\u2019t know my cardinal directions. By the end of the trip, I could always tell which way I was headed. Being able to climb a peak and look back on the mountains, ridges, and valleys we had covered is unlike anything I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nFor more details about the course and a day-by-day account from the students themselves, visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/envir495onp2015.blogspot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">class blog<\/a>.\u00a0To check out more photos from the 2015 class, check out this Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.864059187003902.1073741832.244759142267246&amp;type=3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">photo album<\/a> from the College of the Environment."},{"title":"A living laboratory","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/living-lab\/","tags":["alumni","college-of-the-environment","faculty","giving","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"Through the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, Sarah Schooler, \u201915, spent six weeks in the Alaskan bush, collecting the same data in the field she\u2019d been studying in the classroom: salmon and the hungry habits of grizzly bears.","content":"(Homepage, October 2015)\n\n\"Male, brain, body.\"\n\n\u201cFemale, belly.\u201d\n\nSeven days a week, Sarah Schooler, \u201915, suits up in chest-high waders, grabs her bear spray, hops a boat, and walks the length of Lake Aleknagik\u2019s Hansen Creek, counting and categorizing every dead sockeye salmon she happens upon, calling out the sex followed by the parts of the body that were consumed.\n\nBrain, body, belly, hump.\n\nSome salmon are floating lifelessly downstream, carried away from the hoards pushing the opposite direction \u2014 upstream \u2014 to spawn.

Her student experience included an internship at Seattle City Light, a quarter studying at Friday Harbor Laboratories, and backpacking workshops through Ecuador and Costa Rica.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until she took a course with Aquatic and Fishery Sciences Professor <a href=\"https:\/\/environment.uw.edu\/faculty\/thomas-quinn\/\">Tom Quinn<\/a> that she realized she wanted a future in fisheries, specifically. He proposed Schooler participate in a senior capstone project with Professor <a href=\"https:\/\/environment.uw.edu\/faculty\/aaron-wirsing\/\">Aaron Wirsing<\/a>, known for his work with some of the biggest and most feared carnivores on the planet: Alaskan grizzly bears. She began working on the project from Seattle, analyzing the data to determine how the bear\u2019s appetite and the condition of the salmon affect what parts of the salmon the bear chooses to eat \u2014 if any.\n\nShe never thought she\u2019d have a chance to actually collect the data she was analyzing until Quinn received a gift from the Education Legacy Fund for a field technician and asked her if she\u2019d be interested in coming up to Alaska for the summer. \u201cWhen I thought of my ideal summer scenario, it was to go to Alaska.

When commercial fishing of salmon began more than a century ago, management came down to one loosely enforced rule: don\u2019t overfish. Restrictions on fishing gear and location were placed, then Congress passed an act that required 50 percent of the returning salmon made it to spawning grounds. But there was no science to back it up, and when the population started to diminish by millions, the industry turned to the University of Washington for answers: Why has there been such a dramatic decline in population? What can we do management-wise to restore the salmon runs to their original level?\n\nThat was in 1946. Fast-forward 70 years later, and the UW has a suite of summer camp\u2013like facilities in southwest Alaska dedicated entirely to looking at factors \u2014 evolutionary, ecological and industry-related \u2014 influencing sockeye salmon production that are led by the pioneers in the field: Tom Quinn, Ray Hilborn and Daniel Schindler, all fisheries professors in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences."},{"title":"China, revisited","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/china-revisited\/","tags":["arts-sciences","faculty","global","athletics","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Jane Yang, a UW sophomore who grew up in Shanghai, is teaching the UW men's basketball team about her language and culture.

She makes sure that the class gets this phrase right. It will be useful, after all: The UW men open their basketball season on Nov. 14\u00a0against the University of Texas \u2014\u00a0in Shanghai, China.\n\nIn preparation for this trip, the entire men\u2019s basketball team is taking a travel-writing course that covers culture, customs, teamwork and identity. English Professor Shawn Wong leads the majority of each class, but Yang is the class\u2019 Mandarin tutor, and she begins each day by teaching the players basic phrases.\n\nBorn in Taiwan but raised in Shanghai, Yang graduated from an international school and is fluent in Mandarin, English and Spanish. With plans to major in English and communication \u2014 and to be a teacher or professor someday \u2014 she is also challenging herself at the UW as a teaching assistant for another of Wong\u2019s writing courses, and as a writing tutor at the Odegaard Undergraduate Library\u2019s Writing &amp; Research Center. So far, she\u2019s learned that the act of teaching is often inseparable from self-discovery \u2014 especially when it comes to teaching others about China.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been interesting telling the class about Mandarin and looking at their responses,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes me see my own culture with a different set of eyes.\u201d\n\nThe players are full of questions, many of which keep Yang thinking long after class is over.\n\n\u201cDo Mandarin characters come from pictures? Why do they look this way?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy is the word for \u2018rice\u2019 the same as the word for \u2018meal\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are so many people going to want to take pictures with us? Why is it that big of a deal?\u201d\n\nThis last question comes after a discussion of the throngs of curious photo-seekers that will surround the basketball team when they\u2019re in public in China. And it brings up another one of Yang\u2019s roles for this course: She\u2019ll be traveling to China with the team as their interpreter \u2014 or, as she calls it, \u201clanguage bodyguard.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to get to China and be surrounded by people that are all talking to them and be like, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAnd me just being there, making them feel comfortable, it should help a lot. It\u2019s going to teach me a lot about my own home, too.\u201d\n\nBut for how different China and the U.S. may be, one thing they have in common is their love for basketball. Over 300 million people in China play the sport \u2014 including Yang.\n\nWhen Yang, who was a power forward on her high school basketball team, first came to the UW and was reeling from the shock of living in a new country, she spent all of her free time playing pickup basketball on campus. \u201cI would go to class and then go to the gym to play basketball,\u201d she says. \u201cI latched onto it right away \u2014 being on a basketball court just makes me feel comfortable.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not an uncommon feeling, to look forward to something familiar, even when you\u2019re more than 5,000 miles from home.\n\nMarquese Chriss, the UW\u2019s freshman power forward from Elk Grove, Calif., echoes Yang\u2019s sense of comfort on the court, no matter where it is: \u201cI\u2019ve never played this far away from home, and I\u2019m excited to see such a big city, to see how other people live their lives,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s still the same, really. All our teammates are still there, all our coaches are there. It\u2019s just a different court. I\u2019m just excited to play.\u201d\n<h2>Learning off the court<\/h2>\nThe men\u2019s basketball team will spend the second half of their weeklong trip in Shanghai, focusing on their showdown with the Longhorns.\n\nFor the first half of their trip, though, they\u2019ll travel to the historic city of Hangzhou, also home to China\u2019s e-commerce giant, Alibaba Group. In addition to touring the Alibaba corporate campus as guests of founder Jack Ma \u2014 and practicing at its basketball facilities \u2014 the team will visit historic sites like the Temple of Soul\u2019s Retreat, the Grand Canal and the Tomb of General Yue Fei. For these excursions, the players will research and prepare presentations.\n\n\u201cThe students themselves will be the tour guides,\u201d says Wong. \u201cThis is not just any trip \u2014\u00a0the Athletic Department doesn\u2019t want them to sit in hotels, but to get out and experience, to learn.\u201d\n<h2>The UW in Shanghai: basketball and beyond<\/h2>\nThis month\u2019s basketball game is one of several events in Shanghai that celebrate the UW\u2019s growing connection to its many partners in China.

Women, carrying 45 pounds of branches and twigs, are vulnerable, exposed to violence, harassment, sexual abuse \u2014 all in an effort to simply feed their families.\n\nThis is a reality for nearly half the world\u2019s population, which has relied on three-stone fires for everything from eating to heating for generations. That\u2019s <em>billions<\/em> of people burning wood, charcoal \u2014 whatever they can find \u2014 in their homes, inhaling smoke and fumes daily.

From there, stoves are sent to Kenya, where focus groups test and give feedback.\n\nAllawatt first got involved with the project after his thermodynamics professor sparked his love for mechanical engineering and its real-world applications and introduced him to research opportunities \u201cRight away, as an undergraduate, I was working with graduate students and being invited to meetings with professors I\u2019d never even seen before,\u201d he says.\n\nProfessors like Kramlich, who took note of Allawatt\u2019s skills and offered him a research assistant position on the clean cookstoves project.

Education had always been valued at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wahksd.k12.wa.us\/whsindex.shtml\">Wahkiakum High School<\/a>, but college wasn\u2019t the typical path for most students. Even its top scholars didn\u2019t have the skills to be competitive in higher education or career readiness.\n\nThere was a lot at stake for the entire community as well, a place where depleted economic resources had affected the livelihood of many residents. Fifty percent of the school\u2019s 135 students were on free or reduced lunch.\n\nBut thanks to a principal and team of teachers willing to initiate change, as well as support from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/omad\/gear-up\/\">UW GEAR UP Educator Development Initiative (EDI),<\/a>attending college is becoming the expectation \u2013 not the exception \u2013 at Wahkiakum High School.\n\nTo help turn the tides, Wahkiakum staff created a quarter-credit program called Mule Success. Named after the school mascot, its intent is to equip students with tools and skills to successfully pursue college or career readiness. For 30 minutes during the regular school day, three days a week, students have access to organized study skills sessions, individual mentoring, peer tutoring and leadership activities. The staff also brought Advanced Placement classes into the curriculum and created a community partnership with Lower Columbia College to expose students to early college placement testing.\n\nAmong the key components that helped Wahkiakum integrate these changes were tools and resources they acquired through professional development opportunities offered by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gearup.wa.gov\/\">Washington State GEAR UP<\/a> (Gaining Early Awareness &amp; Readiness for Undergraduate Programs) and their partnership with UW\u2019s GEAR UP EDI.\n\nGEAR UP EDI is housed within the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/omad\/\">UW Office of Minority Affairs &amp; Diversity<\/a>(OMA&amp;D). It provides support for educators who work with low-income middle and high school students served by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gearup.wa.gov\/\">Washington State GEAR UP<\/a>.\n\nSuccess for Wahkiakum came fast. The percentage of students receiving low grades quickly decreased. Students started talking about their grades and showing pride in their progress. School assemblies were held to celebrate academic excellence. Eighty-seven percent of the graduating class of 2014 enrolled in college or enlisted in the military.\n\nThe staff is also \u2013 through presentations at conferences such as last June\u2019s UW GEAR UP EDI Summer Institute \u2013 showing teachers how their success can be replicated at other similar schools across the state.\n\n<strong>Let\u2019s Tell Our Story\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong>\n\nAbout one year into the Mule Success program, math teacher Michele Haberlach approached Leitz with an idea.\n\nHaberlach was also new to Wahkiakum and one of the teachers at the forefront of initiating the school\u2019s culture shift. A former helicopter pilot in the United States military, she previously taught at an urban school. It occurred to her that perhaps what they were doing at rural Wahkiakum was special.\n\n\u201cI think we should tell our story,\u201d Haberlach said to Leitz. \u201cI looked at the numbers and they are pretty impressive. I have a feeling that (other schools) just aren\u2019t doing this.\u201d\n\nLeitz and Haberlach first presented their work at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gearup.wa.gov\/calendar\/gear-west\">GEAR UP West Conference<\/a> last October. It received such a great response, UW GEAR UP EDI Director Roseann London asked them to do the same for college access staff and principals at a workshop in March.\n\n\u201cThe steps that Wahkiakum has taken to increase expectations and prepare students for education after high school requires courage, creativity and collaboration,\u201d said London. \u201cI asked the team to share so that other similar schools could learn from their successes, as well as be inspired by their willingness to try new things and think outside of the box.\u201dLondon again tapped Wahkiakum to make their presentation to GEAR UP teachers from across the state at her annual summer institute at the UW in June. Called \u201cTeaching Today for College Tomorrow,\u201d the four-day event at McCarty Hall provided curriculum resources and instructional strategies for preparing low-income students for success in higher education.\n\n<strong>Teachers Teaching Teachers<\/strong>\n\nWahkiakum\u2019s presentation detailed how they have integrated Mule Success into their school day and provided opportunities for teachers to participate in activities that got them thinking about what they might be able to do at their own schools.\n\nHaving Wahkiakum present their work at the summer institute was a natural fit considering that GEAR UP resources had played such a key role in what they\u2019ve been able to accomplish.\n\nFor instance, English teacher Audrey Petterson, who joined Haberlach for the presentation at the UW, implemented changes in her reading curriculum based on material received from previous GEAR UP sessions. She is now able to better align her students with college and career readiness standards.\n\nBoth Petterson and Haberlach agreed the professional connections they make with other teachers at these events are critical to success as well, especially those from communities who face similar economic challenges.\n\n\u201cSometimes we forget that if you\u2019re small, remote and rural, your kids have some of the same challenges that an urban minority kid is going to have in an inner-city setting,\u201d Haberlach said. \u201cI really appreciate the fact that Roseann gets that and she gets that there a lots of communities like us. If you can bring us together, we can share really good ideas that work.\u201d\n\nAccording to Petterson, having the opportunity to \u201cteach other teachers\u201d allowed them to also evaluate their progress thus far.\n\n\u201cAny time that you have to present to a group, you reflect on what you did and how it could be replicated,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that reflection is a part of education. If we don\u2019t look to see what we\u2019re doing that\u2019s working well, how are we to advance? The next logical step is sharing.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what her best advice would be for other schools looking to replicate Wahkiakum\u2019s efforts, Haberlach had a simple suggestion.\n\n\u201cBe brave and be bold,\u201d she said. \u201cThe changes that we\u2019ve made have been pretty substantial. It was very spontaneous but we were all behind it. It worked and it was powerful and the kids bought in. If you have a staff that thinks of education as a team sport and everyone\u2019s got their role, you jump in and do your role with your whole heart and soul, pretty amazing things can happen.\u201d"},{"title":"Early outreach visits encourage students of all ages to think about college","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/early-outreach-visits-encourage-students-of-all-ages-to-think-about-college\/","tags":["college-of-education","graduate-student","office-of-minority-affairs-diversity"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"A group of kindergartners\u00a0turned a few heads when they toured the University of Washington on a sunny day back in April.","content":"(Office of Minority Affairs &amp; Diversity, July 2015)\n\nA group of campus visitors turned a few heads when they toured the University of Washington on a sunny day back in April.\n\nThey could barely contain their excitement at Drumheller Fountain and bounded up the Grand Staircase in Suzzallo Library on their way to the Reading Room (also known as the Harry Potter room). Accompanied by teachers and plenty of parent supervision, they were required to hold hands as they walked through Red Square so as not to get lost. They wore matching t-shirts that read \u201cClass of 2027.\u201d\n\nOn April 21, 80 kindergartners from Meadow Ridge Elementary School visited the UW as a part of the Kent School District\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kent.k12.wa.us\/site\/default.aspx?PageType=3&amp;DomainID=244&amp;ModuleInstanceID=1352&amp;ViewID=047E6BE3-6D87-4130-8424-D8E4E9ED6C2A&amp;RenderLoc=0&amp;FlexDataID=7016&amp;PageID=1730&amp;GroupByField=&amp;GroupYear=0&amp;GroupMonth=0&amp;Tag=\">Kinder to College<\/a> program. They spent the morning on campus to participate in a STEM activity and receive a tour led by UW students.\n\nThe event was hosted by the UW Office of Minority Affairs &amp; Diversity\u2019s (OMA&amp;D) <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/reach\/\">Multicultural Outreach and Recruitment<\/a> team in partnership with the <a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/\">College of Education<\/a>. It was also one of several early outreach visits facilitated by OMA&amp;D in April, May and June that brought over 2,500 students ranging from ages 5-18 to campus.\n\nThe visits were arranged in collaboration with various local school districts, community organizations and other UW partners with one primary purpose in mind: get young people to start thinking about college, especially those who lack access to college preparation resources.\n\n\u201cWe are seeking to create an affinity for postsecondary education at an early age by providing exposure to our campus that is inclusive to first-generation, economically disadvantaged and underrepresented populations,\u201d said Christopher Wells, OMA&amp;D director of community engagement and strategic initiatives.\n<h2>Benefits of Early Exposure<\/h2>\nThe UW is one of 12 college partners of the Kinder to College program which facilitates visits for kindergartners from nearly all 28 elementary schools in the Kent School District (KSD).\n\nAccording to Randy Nu\u00f1ez, \u201902, KSD college and career community\/family liaison, the three goals of the program are to increase early college awareness for their youngest students, foster parent involvement and build relationships with local college partners.\n\nNu\u00f1ez, who is a first-year doctoral student at the UW, says he is often asked if kindergartners are too young to benefit from the experience. \u201cFor us, that\u2019s where the parent piece becomes an important role,\u201d he said.\n\nNu\u00f1ez pointed out that since the program was established in 2009-2010, on average nearly 550 parents per year have attended college visits with their children.\n\n\u201cOur parents are the first and primary teachers of our students, so to be able to have them as part of the experience and have those conversations at home is key,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about our parents who participate, at least half of them say it\u2019s been their first time on a college campus. It also addresses the first-generation barrier. For our parents to be involved in the college conversation, we also want them on a college campus.\u201d\n\nMeadow Ridge kindergarten teacher Lindsey Ellwanger agreed that the experience won\u2019t end when the campus visit is over. \u201cIn class we will continue to talk about it and hopefully it will stick in their memories.\u201d\n<h2>Experiencing College Life<\/h2>\nOMA&amp;D\u2019s spring early outreach visits also brought middle and high school students to campus. Some of those events featured instruction from UW faculty and staff, giving the older students an \u201cinside-the-classroom\u201d look at college life.\n\nFor instance, in May OMA&amp;D hosted 30 members of Hamilton International Middle School\u2019s La Chispa Club, a Latino student leadership group. That event featured a science-focused academic workshop led by Tory Brundage, an adviser and student outreach coordinator with the UW <a href=\"http:\/\/sph.washington.edu\/\">School of Public Health<\/a>.\n\nA June visit for ninth-graders in Chief Sealth High School\u2019s dual language program featured an academic workshop with UW faculty members from the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/spanport.washington.edu\/\">Department of Spanish &amp; Portuguese Studies<\/a>, as well as the <a href=\"https:\/\/linguistics.washington.edu\/\">Department of Linguistics<\/a>. Students also had an opportunity to hear three local industry professionals talk about their work during a panel discussion.\n\nStudents affiliated with community organizations also had opportunities to spend time at the UW. OMA&amp;D partnered with <a href=\"http:\/\/schools.fwps.org\/lakota\/programs\/h-e-r-o-program\/\">HERO<\/a>, a non-profit that provides academic and intervention services for first-generation, low-income and underrepresented middle school males in the Federal Way Public School District. HERO brought 50 of its students to campus for an identity workshop and campus tour in May.\n\nThese particular events are just a few of the <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/reach\/events-and-programs\/\">many<\/a> that OMA&amp;D Multicultural Outreach and Recruitment hosts on campus and throughout the state that prepare underrepresented minority, first-generation and low-income students for college.

Shades of Purple serves rising high school seniors interested in attending the UW.\n\n\u201cOur unit\u2019s outreach efforts are intentional about addressing the barriers to postsecondary education by supporting and providing pre-college preparation and increasing access for each student that we engage with,\u201d Wells said."},{"title":"Creating a Merck Scholar legacy","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/creating-a-merck-scholar-legacy\/","tags":["alumni","arts-sciences","giving","office-of-minority-affairs-diversity","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Senior Taylor Boyd is the fifth Husky to receive a prestigious United Negro College Fund\/Merck Undergraduate Science Research Scholarship.\n\n&nbsp;","content":"(Office of Minority Affairs &amp; Diversity, September 2015)\n\nUniversity of Washington senior Taylor Boyd joined a prestigious group when she received a United Negro College Fund\/Merck Undergraduate Science Research Scholarship for the 2015-16 academic year.\n\nThe honor, which provides up to $25,000 to support tuition and a research-based internship, is awarded to just 15 African American undergraduates from across the nation each year who are interested in pursuing science or engineering.\n\nEven more impressive is the fact that Boyd is the fifth Husky to receive the scholarship since 2010. The neurobiology major follows previous scholarship recipients and alumni Dirir Abdullahi, \u201915 (2014 recipient), Chinonso Opara, \u201814 (2013 recipient), Sarra Tekola, \u201815 (2013 recipient) and Alexandra Herndon, \u201811 (2010 recipient).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting,\u201d said Boyd who wants to become a doctor who works with underserved populations. \u201cI think of it as a window of opportunity because there is so much I know I\u2019ll be able to do now because of it.\u201d\n\nBoyd completed her internship over the summer through a partnership between the University of Venda in South Africa and the University of Virginia. The 10-week long program featured two weeks spent on campus in Charlottesville, Va., and eight weeks doing research in the province of Limpopo in South Africa. Her work studied methods used for curing HIV and AIDS, as well as \u201cthe intersections between their traditional medicine and western medicine.\u201d\n\nBoyd is definitely right about that \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d if the paths of her predecessors are any indication.\n\n<strong>Herndon, who earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in chemistry, just started her third year in medical school at the University of Pennsylvania, where she also works in the hospital and clinics.\u00a0<\/strong>\n\n\u201cBoth the internship and scholarship made a huge impact on my life, both then and now,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the time I was struggling to pay for tuition and housing, working part-time while going to school and pursuing research at the UW.\u201d\n\nThe award not only helped ease Herndon\u2019s financial burdens, it helped shape her academic path after graduation. Through her internship in the medicinal chemistry department at the Merck research site in Rahway, New Jersey, she was exposed to a different field of research in her area of study.\n\n\u201cThe experience I had as a UNCF-Merck scholar allowed me to tailor my goals beyond graduating from the UW,\u201d she said. \u201cI was able to network with various amazing researchers in multiple fields and not solely chemistry. As a result, I began finding answers to many of my curiosities and questions, and began to see how I could do what I was interested in within other contexts.\u201d\n\nToday, Herndon is still debating what area of medicine she would like to focus on, but at the top of her list is emergency medicine and a possible future fellowship in neurology critical care or forensic pathology.\n\n<strong>Opara, who earned his undergraduate degree in biochemistry, is in his second year at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.<\/strong> His award made a lasting impact on his dream to become a physician as well.\n\n\u201cThe Merck internship took me directly behind the scenes into how the medicines we give patients in the hospital on a daily basis make it from the bench to the bedside,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gave me firsthand experience into how pharmaceutical agents could be altered and formulated in ways that take into account the stories that patients bring with them. I hope to be the type of physician who considers issues from all angles and being a Merck Scholar brought me one step closer to that goal.\u201d\n\nThe honor held an ever deeper meaning for Opara. When he was six years old his father (a physician) and his mother (a nurse) moved the family from Nigeria to the United States for greater opportunities.\n\n\u201cAt a young age, I was deeply inspired by the sacrifices my parents made, especially as they worked diligently to earn their respective licenses in the U.S.,\u201d Opara said. \u201cThe internship and scholarship were a direct affirmation of the many sacrifices my family made in order for my siblings and me to benefit from the vast educational opportunities in the United States.\u201d\n\n<strong>For recent graduate Abdullahi, who earned his undergraduate degree in neurobiology last June, the Merck scholarship was the difference-maker for whether he could even pay for his UW tuition.<\/strong>\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be in school without it,\u201d he said. \u201cNor would I be able to support myself and my living conditions well.\u201d\n\nAbdullahi\u2019s internship experience also exposed him to a great deal of opportunity.\n\n\u201cIt really opened up an entirely new side of research I never thought I would enjoy,\u201d he said. \u201cMerck also helped me with counseling, connecting me with different research facilities all across the country. It\u2019s not just money or an internship, there is continuous follow-up which is really nice.\u201d\n\nLike Herndon and Opara, Abdullahi plans to pursue medical school and possibly a Ph.D. as well.\n\n<strong>Tekola\u2019s field of study is a bit different than the other Merck scholars. She graduated in June with a bachelor\u2019s degree in environmental science and resource management.<\/strong> Tekola is working as a legislative aide for Seattle City Councilmember Mike O\u2019Brien and will start a Ph.D. program in sustainability at Arizona State University next year.\n\nBecause many college internships in environmental science are unpaid, it wasn\u2019t until Tekola received the Merck award that she could afford to pursue those positions. As a result, in addition to her Merck-funded scholarship she was able to work at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Bikeworks. Not having to support herself financially while attending school also allowed her to get involved in several causes. Tekola worked on a campaign to get the UW to divest from fossil fuels and became involved in the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nAnd what she learned from these experiences continue to make a lasting impact.\n\n\u201cAll of my internships in the lab allowed me to realize that climate change will not be solved with science but with political and social change,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why I am working in the City Council now, instead of a lab. It is also why I have become politically active and have become an agent of change in my community and globally.\u201d\n\nWhat all five Huskies have in common is that they participated in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/omad\/stem-resources\/\">OMA&amp;D programs<\/a> that support students pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).\n\n\u201cOMA&amp;D does a very good job of connecting its students to vital resources,\u201d said Opara. \u201cFor example, my participation in the STEM bridge program the summer before my freshman year played a large role in helping me get to where I am now. During that time, I was connected with several mentors on campus who helped me get lab and research experience early on. They provided a strong framework from which I further developed my interest in health and medicine.\u201d\n\nAnd Opara doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that so many OMA&amp;D students have been recognized with the Merck award.\n\n\u201cHaving known several of my UW STEM colleagues, I can attest that they are among the hardest working students I know,\u201d he said. \u201cI am very proud of what we have been able to accomplish.\u201d"},{"title":"Former astronaut lands at the College of the Environment","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/former-astronaut-lands-at-the-college-of-the-environment\/","tags":["college-of-built-environments","college-of-the-environment","graduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger, a former astronaut, is now part of the interdisciplinary <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ess.washington.edu\/ess\/education\/grad\/message\/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\">Masters in Earth and Space Sciences in Applied Geosciences<\/a> program.","content":"<h2>Dream big<\/h2>\nA question from one of her students at Hudson\u2019s Bay High School in Vancouver, Wash., changed the trajectory of Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger\u2019s life:\n\n\u201cMrs. ML, how do astronauts use the restroom in space?\u201d\n\nThe Earth sciences and astronomy teacher looked for the answer online, but got more than she bargained for: NASA wanted to send math and science teachers to space.\n\nAs a child, she had created an astronaut out of a ketchup bottle and attended space camp. As an undergrad\u00a0who studied geology\u2014the dirt beneath our feet\u2014the opportunity begged what might lie ahead for her in the big sky.\n\n\u201cHow could I tell my students to follow their dreams if I wasn\u2019t willing to?\u201d she said.\n<h2>All systems go<\/h2>\nArriving in Florida with her husband and their young daughter, she got to work immediately with wilderness survival training, underwater simulations, team-building exercises, and T-38 flight school. She also memorized the location and functionality of 1,500 switches used to operate a shuttle and its systems.\u00a0In April 2004, Metcalf-Lindenburger got the call\u2014she was part of NASA\u2019s newest astronaut class.\n\nOn a calm, dark morning in April 2010, the sleep-shifted STS-131 crew stood 195 feet above ground on the Space Shuttle Discovery\u2019s launch pad.\n\n\u201cThree miles away my family, friends, and colleagues were waiting to watch. I felt this peace and knew it was going to be amazing,\u201d Metcalf-Lindenburger said.\n\nThe 8.5-minute <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_NeCvBCZbC8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">journey into space<\/a> began like a shifting, jerky rollercoaster ride. When the solid rocket boosters fell into the ocean, the orange, external tank made for a smoother trek. Moving at a top speed of around 17,000 miles per hour, the g-force weighed on the crew and breathing was labored. Then, Metcalf-Lindenburger says, \u201cThe main engine cuts off and you\u2019re in space. You float up into your seatbelt and look down at Europe.\u201d\n\nIn addition to operating the robotic arm, one of the most demanding skills required of a mission specialist, Metcalf-Lindenburger directed the team\u2019s space walks, relayed information to and from the ground, and addressed maintenance issues. When the opportunity arose though, she allowed herself to relish in the grandness of her situation.\n\n\u201cDuring one walk, we were waiting to hear from Houston. I said, \u201cWell, wait, where are we?\u201d The sun was coming up over Earth. We had to honor that moment,\u201d Metcalf-Lindenburger said.\n\nIn 15 days, the team had successfully unloaded cargo from their primary payload, the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module.\n\nSix years of training, an eight-minute slingshot ride into space, and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity seized. Metcalf-Lindenburger thought about her family and friends as she passed over a cloudless Pacific Northwest en route to Kennedy Space Center.\n<h2>Landing at the UW<\/h2>\n\u201cWhen you see, literally see, how thin the atmosphere is, it drives home the fragility of our planet,\u201d she said.\n\nMetcalf-Lindenburger learned more about the way the planet works by leaving it. She saw a volcanic eruption, calving icebergs, and drought-stricken regions. She witnessed the interconnectedness of the Earth\u2019s systems and was inspired to protect the resources keeping those systems functional.\n\nAt the University of Washington\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/coenv.washington.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">College of the Environment<\/a>, Metcalf-Lindenburger is part of the interdisciplinary <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ess.washington.edu\/ess\/education\/grad\/message\/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Masters in Earth and Space Sciences in Applied Geosciences<\/a> program.

Stationed across the island in the late 2000s, Barnea, who\u2019s currently working toward his law degree at the University of Washington, never knew what a day would bring.\n\n\u201cAs a Peace Corps volunteer, you\u2019re sort of always on call,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I miss most about Jamaica.\u201d\n\nBefore he gave his life to serving others, he was a student. His ties to the UW reach back much further than his time in class, though \u2014 Barnea was brought up in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hfs.washington.edu\/familyhousing\/#gsc.tab=0\">UW Family Housing<\/a> as his immigrant parents, who believed strongly in public service, earned degrees from the University.Being on call meant some days were spent forming relationships with the fishermen, diving to study invasive species or traveling to the bush to help farmers plant pineapple bushes. Others were devoted to working with kids, collaborating on an illustrated book that helped teach children about lionfish \u2014\u00a0a mystifying sea creature that wreaked havoc on the local reef ecology and changed the way locals made a living. He even helped construct a saltwater aquarium to further educate the Jamaicans about life under the surface of the sea.\n\n\u201cUW Family Housing was probably the closest thing to a kibbutz \u2014 a collective farming settlement common in Israel, where my father was raised \u2014 on the planet,\u201d says Barnea. \u201cIt was an amazing place to grow up; everyone looked out for each other and it was a very international village, with Ph.D. candidates and post-doctorates from all around the world.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fitting, then, that Barnea first went to the UW \u2014 \u201ca first-rate institution right in my backyard\u201d \u2014 to earn his bachelor\u2019s in the <a href=\"https:\/\/chid.washington.edu\/\">comparative history of ideas<\/a> (CHID) while working at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/carlson\/\">Carlson Leadership &amp; Public Service Center<\/a>. CHID is an interdisciplinary study that examines the relationship between ideas and their cultural, historical and political contexts, and sends students to countries all across the world.\n\nBarnea was sent to South Africa. \u201cIt was really eye opening and adjusted my perspective, and my experience witnessing the underdeveloped townships made me want to serve in the developing world,\u201d he says. Barnea\u2019s CHID studies and time in South Africa prepared him for the culture shock of living in Jamaica \u2014 a postcolonial country, like South Africa, struggling with many of the same complex development issues.\n<blockquote>\u201cThe Peace Corps is there because Jamaica is a country that\u2019s not quite where it needs to be. There\u2019s a deep, troubled history that\u2019s really ever-present,\u201d says Barnea. \u201cI trust that my time there helped promote peace and friendship and move things in the right direction.\u201d<\/blockquote>\nBarnea earned his masters in marine affairs from the UW when he returned from the Peace Corps, and now, he\u2019s working toward his law degree with hopes of one day finding a future in the environmental field. \u201cI believe very strongly in giving back to the community,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cLike law, the work I did in the Peace Corps gave me an opportunity to balance the needs of the systems with the needs of the people. At the UW, I\u2019ve learned to be very aware of how complex culture actually is, and to approach it with humility, curiosity and gratitude to the people who take the time and effort to extend trust to you.

Where a socialist party in Europe might win a small but consistent share of seats in elections, the United States has no competitive socialist party in most elections.\n\nInstead, radicalism in America operates through social movements. Think of the movements for labor rights, civil rights, women\u2019s rights, or environmental protection. Think of marriage rights, immigrant rights, Occupy Wall Street, or Black Lives Matter.\n\nUniversity of Washington historian James Gregory calls such movements \u201cfluorescences\u201d \u2014 they flare up suddenly and often fade just as quickly, leaving uncertain change in their wake. Because they operate outside of electoral politics, they\u2019re often overlooked by historians and political scientists, Gregory says.\n\nHis new project, <strong>Mapping American Social Movements through the Twentieth Century<\/strong>, takes a groundbreaking approach to examining such movements. Through digital maps, charts, and other visualizations, the online project creates a political geography of American radicalism. The mapping dimension shows how movements arise from particular hotbeds, such as New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Chicago. That geography changes over time: Oklahoma and other Great Plains states were strongholds of socialism early in the twentieth century, according to Gregory\u2019s analysis of socialist newspaper records.\n\nOther maps track Socialist Party membership, Industrial Workers of the World chapters, and union strikes and arrests.

Picture the aloof figure strolling the countryside, plucking images from nature to describe his inner state. Something triggers an epiphany and he goes home to reflect on it, lonely as a cloud. In Wordsworth\u2019s famous formulation, poetry is \u201cthe spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility.\u201d\n\nBut the meaning of \u201ccloud\u201d has changed in the digital age. Rather than solitude, it suggests the interconnected nature of data and people. With that shift, the possibilities of poetry are changing too.\n\nThat\u2019s the premise behind <a title=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/simpsoncenter.org\/projects\/affect-audience-digital-age\">Affect &amp; Audience in the Digital Age<\/a>, a research project at the Simpson Center for the Humanities. It\u2019s led by Sarah Dowling and Amaranth Borsuk, two assistant professors in the School of Interdisciplinary Arts &amp; Sciences at UW Bothell who teach in an innovative Master of Fine Arts program. They\u2019re joined by Brian Reed, Chair and Professor of English and Professor of Comparative Literature at UW Seattle, and Gregory Laynor, Doctoral Candidate in English.\n\nThe project is part of a larger constellation of creative projects by poets and scholars taking a distinctly collaborative approach for rethinking poetry in the digital age. That approach shows that the artist\u2019s life doesn\u2019t have to be anti-social, says Dowling.\n\n\u201cOne thing that often turns people off from wanting to be involved in the arts is the sense that you\u2019re stuck by yourself in a garret starving and sweating over a project that nobody but you cares about,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a very attractive view. Thinking about methods of creation that are more social and socially engaged is a much nicer way to imagine what your life is going to be like.\u201d\n<h2>Intensities of Emotion<\/h2>\nThe name Affect &amp; Audience is a response to the idea that avant-garde art is somehow cold or unfeeling, a stereotype the group wanted to explore. Instead of focusing on personal feelings alone, the group examines the concept of<em>affect<\/em>\u2014outward manifestations of feelings or emotions. Where a feeling belongs to an individual, affect can be communal: the palpable tension in a room or the shared excitement at a wedding.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where our interests converged,\u201d Dowling said. \u201cThere is this sense that experimental arts are about flattening out feeling and achieving a degree of distance or coolness. Even though that idea is as old as Immanuel Kant and has been critiqued a lot, it still has a lot of sway.\u201d\n\nReed traces the need for affect studies back to the rise of modernism in the 1920s. Modernist scholars distrusted emotional responses to art as too personal and subjective (and perhaps too feminine) to study rigorously. Critics like T.S. Eliot looked for objective methods to study the form and structure of a text. How readers feel about a work of art didn\u2019t interest formalist critics, says Reed.\n\nOver the last several decades, that has changed.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen, slowly, is a recognition that the reason people go to movies and read books is all about experiencing intensities of emotion,\u201d said Reed. \u201cScholars have realized they need to have a theory of emotion in order to talk about how texts move people and change people. Minus emotion, you can talk about those things, but you don\u2019t get very far.\u201d\n\nSo the group hosts writers like Kate Durbin, whose book <em>E! Entertainment<\/em> (Wonder, 2014) reads like a series of recaps of \u201cReal Housewives\u201d style TV shows. Her vignettes are packed with group emotion and drama, says Dowling. It was fitting that her reading wasn\u2019t a solitary performance but a group reading, with audience members cast as reality-show stars.\n\n\u201cMaybe we haven\u2019t seen this an appropriate subject for poetry because it seems coarse or ridiculous, but this is what people like,\u201d said Dowling. \u201cPeople really connect with it and get pleasure from it. So I think it\u2019s very interesting to look at that through a different lens.\u201d\n\nThe group behind Affect &amp; Audience in the Digital Age recently published an<a title=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.essaypress.org\/ep-14\/\">e-book by the same name<\/a>, curated by Borsuk, that captures discussions about the future of poetry from a 2013 colloquium at the Simpson Center. Presented as a series of two-person dialogues, the book represents the conversational nature of the group\u2019s inquiry.\n\n\u201cSince the work we\u2019re talking about is about breaking boundaries and opening conversations, we wanted to create something in the spirit of what we had done,\u201d said Reed. \u201cThe book is a joint statement, but it\u2019s a joint statement in different directions. We did not force conformity.\u201d\n<h2>Sculptors of Language<\/h2>\nThe conversations in the book test the idea that poetry can be more than solitary thinkers dwelling on their inner thoughts (although there\u2019s a place for that too!).\n\nFor Dowling, that conviction guides how she teaches her students, who typically include speakers of multiple languages. Together they manipulate text through Google Translate and other online translators, including deliberately \u201cbad\u201d ones. Running text through several languages and back to English yields up delightfully weird results that reveal both the limits of auto-translation and the essential strangeness of language.\n\n\u201cThat has been quite productive for me not just in teaching but in my own work too,\u201d Dowling said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of making my relationship with language a little more strange.\u201d\n\nAnother speaker at the 2013 event, Canadian poet Rachel Zolf, works with optical character recognition (OCR) technology that can digitize vast amounts of historic documents\u2014albeit with occasional errors. In her book<em>Janey\u2019s Arcadia<\/em> (Coach House, 2014), Zolf examines historical records from European settlers colonizing First Nations people in what is now Canada. OCR serves as both a useful tool and a metaphor: like colonists, it brings unprecedented power but also great potential for error and misunderstanding.\n\nThe Affect &amp; Audience group draws inspiration from Claudia Rankine, whose <em>Citizen: An American Lyric <\/em>(Graywolf, 2014), a National Book Award finalist, compiles micro-aggressions experienced by Rankine\u2019s friends and colleagues. Rankine tells stories in the second person, so that \u201cyou,\u201d the reader, gain a sense of the insults felt by racial minorities in the United States.\n\nDowling also cites <a title=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.poets.org\/poetsorg\/text\/brief-guide-flarf-poetry\">flarf poetry<\/a> that gathers unconventional material, such as search-engine queries or online hate speech, and arranges it into poems that would be considered ugly or inelegant by conventional standards. What these diverse works have in common is the way poets function as sculptors of language, finding promising new materials to manipulate and shape.\n<h2>The Crowdsourced MFA<\/h2>\nOf course, poetry hasn\u2019t stood still since the Romantic period. Poets and artists for centuries have experimented with new media and responded to both high-brow and low-brow culture. Wordsworth himself was a collaborator, working with Samuel Taylor Coleridge to reflect the language of everyday people in <em>Lyrical Ballads<\/em> (1798).\n\nAs the Affect &amp; Audience group continues, they join a long conversation about experimentalism and tradition, and solitary and communal creation. On Friday, May 22, they host multi-genre writers <a title=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/simpsoncenter.org\/calendar?trumbaEmbed=view%3Devent%26eventid%3D114733815\">Joyelle McSweeney and Don Mee Choi<\/a> for a discussion about writing across languages.\n\nAnother creation the group has celebrated, <a title=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/jacket2.org\/article\/tolerance-project\"><em>The Tolerance Project<\/em><\/a>by Rachel Zolf, solicited contributions for a large online document exploring the value of tolerance. Zolf calls it her \u201ccrowdsourced MFA.\u201d Her method suggests that even old-fashioned notions like wisdom belong to the collective and not just the individual.\n\nSaid Dowling, \u201cIt critiques the sense that MFA programs at times reinforce the notion of \u2018individual genius,\u2019 which isn\u2019t always helpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt takes a community to sustain a creative practice.\u201d\n\n<em>Get the free e-book <\/em><a title=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.essaypress.org\/ep-14\/\">Affect &amp; Audience in the Digital Age<\/a><em> from Essay Press.<\/em>\n\n&nbsp;"},{"title":"Humanitarian jihad and the problem with essentializing Islam","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/humanitarian-jihad-and-the-problem-with-essentializing-islam\/","tags":["arts-sciences","faculty","global"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"Kashmiri militants tell UW anthropologist Cabeiri Robinson why they put down weapons and picked up shovels after a devastating earthquake.","content":"(Simpson Center for the Humanities homepage, September 2015)\n\nWhen UW anthropologist Cabeiri Robinson returned to Kashmiri Pakistan one month after the horrific 2005 earthquake, it was more than a professional visit. She had conducted years of ethnography in the Azad Kashmir region to produce her first book, <em>Body of Victim, Body of Warrior: Refugee Families and the Making of Kashmiri Jihadists<\/em>. Along the way she developed close personal relationships within the communities she studied.\n\nAfter the earthquake that devastated cities and rural areas, killing more than 50,000 people, Robinson found a transformed region. She focused her study on three groups. First were international aid organizations that had previously avoided Kashmir because of its disputed nature between Pakistan and India. After the disaster, those groups brought an influx of aid workers, along with a faith that humanitarian aid can be politically neutral. But relief efforts, like disasters, always have a political dimension.\n\n\u201cJust because disasters have something to do with the natural world doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s anything natural about the way they play out,\u201d said Robinson, <a title=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/jsis.washington.edu\/faculty\/cdr33.shtml\">Associate Professor<\/a> in the Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies. \u201cThey play out along pre-existing structures of inequality, social relationships, and hierarchies. You have to be willing to examine that to understand reconstruction.\u201d\n\nShe also observed a wave of young Kashmiri people making new discoveries about their homeland. As they worked as translators for aid groups, traveling near the disputed border with India, they saw how the long-term threat of artillery fire crippled the ability of families to farm or send their children to school.\n\n\u201cThese young people encountered real, serious poverty just a few hundred kilometers from where they had always lived,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cFor many of them, it led to a commitment to addressing development issues broader than the earthquake. It got a lot of them acting very differently about their society and politics.\u201d\n\nThird, and perhaps most remarkably, Robinson saw jihadist fighters set up the first field hospital in Muzaffarabad city in the weeks after the earthquake. They dug people out of rubble and delivered food and water. They buried the dead according to local burial customs. They gave her a name for what they were doing: \u201cThey said, \u2018Hum humanitarian jihad kar rahe hai\u00f1\u2019 \u2014 \u2018We are doing humanitarian jihad,\u2019\u201d Robinson said.\n\nThese militant groups were not permanently renouncing violence in their fight for control of Kashmir. But they told Robinson it was the appropriate act for the moment.\n\n\u201cTheir notion of jihad, which is very controversial, is that they were actively fighting to defend the rights of their family members or people in Indian Jammu and Kashmir,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter the earthquake, they said the service required by Kashmiris was of a different kind. It was no longer the right moment to be carrying weapons. It was the moment to be carrying a shovel.\u201d\n\nRobinson studied these transformations as a 2014-15 fellow of the\u00a0<a title=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/simpsoncenter.org\/programs\/fellowships\/society-of-scholars\">Society of Scholars<\/a>, a program at the Simpson Center for the Humanities that brings UW scholars together across disciplines to discuss and sharpen their work. Each year the program typically supports eight faculty and three doctoral students who meet biweekly to present on their books or projects in progress.\n\nRobinson\u2019s working book title is <em>Fault Lines: Humanitarian Jihad, Humanitarian Business, and the Making of a Post-Conflict Tourist Industry in Northern Pakistan<\/em>.\n\nHumanitarian jihadists taught her about their sense of accountability to their communities. That underscored a broader problem with the Western tendency to \u201cessentialize\u201d Islam, believing that Muslims in Kashmir, or Syria, or Indonesia, or California share the same concerns and values. They share a religion, but they also have distinct histories and cultures unique to their homes, said Robinson.\n\nThe decision of Kashmiri militants to help rebuild their society, she said, is \u201cvery difficult to explain if your understanding of why people fight in Muslim societies is reduced to a narrow religious textual understanding of the concept of Jihad.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople living in particular Muslim societies are very much living with the same kinds of questions about their place in the world as people in non-Muslim societies,\u201d she said.\n\nLearn more about the <a title=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/simpsoncenter.org\/programs\/fellowships\/society-of-scholars\">Society of Scholars<\/a>."},{"title":"Friday Harbor Labs outreach excites budding scientists","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/friday-harbor-labs-outreach-excites-budding-scientists\/","tags":["college-of-the-environment","faculty"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"Through the Friday Harbor Labs Science Outreach Program, UW scientists partner with K-12 classrooms\u00a0in the San Juan Islands to help students learn about\u00a0the fantastic\u00a0marine ecosystem in their backyard.","content":"(College of the Environment, May 2015)\n\nIt\u2019s a picture-perfect day on the shores of San Juan Island\u2019s Griffin Bay.

But the exchange really took flight when the two groups shared long bus rides and evenings of karaoke.\n\n\u201cOur students had a chance to really experience the similarities and differences between the two cultures that went way beyond their design projects,\u201d says <strong>Christopher Ozubko<\/strong>, professor of design in the <a href=\"http:\/\/art.washington.edu\/\">School of Art + Art History + Design<\/a> (SoA+AH+D), who organized the exchange. \u201cThey were adventurous and spent time with the Chinese students, learning about their lives. Those are experiences you can\u2019t get as a tourist.\u201d\n\nOzubko has seen the benefit of such student exchanges before, including two previous exchanges in China. The first, offered nearly 15 years ago, brought together design faculty and students from the UW and Tsinghua University in Beijing. Students designed posters at their home university around a shared theme, and faculty planned week-long design workshops at each other\u2019s school. UW faculty taught their workshop in Beijing, but when Tsinghua faculty were unable to reciprocate due to bureaucratic glitches in China, a new plan emerged. \u201cWe all agreed to use the grant money to bring our students over to China instead,\u201d says Ozubko, who was thrilled to offer his students such an opportunity.\n\nMore than a decade later, Professor <strong>Zhang Zhixian<\/strong> at Southeast University (SEU) in Nanjing proposed a similar exchange after spending a year at the UW as a visiting scholar. Students once again designed posters with a shared theme, but this time\u2014with support from SEU and the Ministry of Education of China\u2014faculty and students from both universities had the opportunity to travel across the Pacific when the posters were exhibited in Nanjing and then at SoA+AH+D\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/art.washington.edu\/about\/artfacilities\/galleries\/sand-point\/\">Sand Point Gallery<\/a>.\n\nThe program was offered in 2013 and again this summer, with a graduate studio course anchoring the experience this year. The UW students, as well as their peers in Nanjing, designed two-sided posters exploring the theme of \u201cEarth.\u201d On one side they offered a visually persuasive message; on the other, detailed data supporting that message.\n\nMost students spent the bulk of their project time selecting and researching an Earth-related topic. One poster compared the land and water resources required to raise lamb, chicken and beef. Another highlighted the amount of water sold on the UW campus and what happens to the bottles after use. For a poster about carbon emissions generated during the production of concrete, the designer explored options for reducing concrete in buildings. Though they were packed with information, the posters were skillfully designed so that the overarching message resonated.\n\n\u201cDesigners take complex ideas and present them in a way that provokes inquiry,\u201d says Ozubko. \u201cThey should draw you in for a little bit more discovery. The goal is to get people interested in learning more about the issue.\u201d\n\nUW students <strong>Chad Hall<\/strong> and <strong>Catherine Lim<\/strong> worked collaboratively on a poster that incorporated product design, proposing wearable items built upon existing technologies. With a bit of humor, they imagined a miniaturized wind turbine to be worn on the shoulder, an epidermal patch to increase the wearer\u2019s empathy, and a vest and catheter combination that would filter urine into drinking water. \u201cOur intention was to ask why we don\u2019t take more drastic measures on our own bodies to decrease our impact on natural resources,\u201d explains Lim. \u201cThe tactics of fashion and advertising were used to present these ridiculous \u2014 yet still feasible and believable \u2014 products in an appealing way, as if extreme sustainability could be some kind of status symbol. The humor in the tone was a way for us to provoke conversation.\u201d\n\nWhen the UW students traveled to Nanjing to share their posters, the cultural differences were obvious, with the SEU students putting a different spin on the \u201cEarth\u201d theme. \u201cEarth to them seemed to have a much more central focus on actual soil and physical space,\u201d says Hall. \u201cMany of us had interpreted Earth to be a holistic entity and ecosystem, which is how many of us actually focused on human behavior and how it affects the Earth as an ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe different perspective led to some unexpected responses. In a poster about carbon emissions and trade, UW student <strong>Geoff Gray<\/strong> suggested that westerners buying products made in China should take ownership of carbon emissions associated with the manufacture of those products. To his surprise, the SEU students thought the message was that China is shipping pollution around the world. \u201cHaving a chance to explain the poster changed their attitudes almost instantly,\u201d Gray says.\n\nStudents in China also interact with their professors differently than students in the U.S., as\u00a0Ozubko learned while leading workshops there through the years. \u201cThe students never present their work and talk about it in a group,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a critique system. And they never question their professors. At American universities, students learn to discuss, debate, and take criticism from each other as well as the instructor.\u201d\n\nDespite their differences, the\u00a0SEU and UW students did find common ground. \u00a0As they spent more time together, they discussed everything from music and relationships to selfie sticks and politics \u2014 and of course, design. \u201cEveryone there was very hospitable and constantly went above and beyond for us in a very genuine way,\u201d says Hall.\n\nThe UW students look forward to returning the favor. In October, all of the posters will be exhibited at the UW\u2019s Sand Point Gallery, with SEU faculty and students traveling from China to Seattle for the opening. \u00a0Ozubko hopes the visit will be one of many to come. \u201cZhang and I hope to do this exchange every other year,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to have this ongoing connection with designers across the Pacific.\u201d\n\n<em>The UW-SEU poster exhibition will open at UW's <a href=\"http:\/\/art.washington.edu\/about\/artfacilities\/galleries\/sand-point\/\">Sand Point Gallery <\/a>on October 2, with an opening reception from 5 to\u00a08 pm (introductions and selected student presentations starting at 6:30 pm).

Huskies<\/h2>\n<strong>John Cole<\/strong>, \u201966, was in danger of becoming a TV-snubbing book snob in the 1960s when the director of the graduate School of Librarianship \u2013 now the iSchool \u2013 shook up his thinking. Even if they didn\u2019t watch TV, Professor Irving Lieberman told his students it was their duty to learn about it and keep informed about it. The director\u2019s eyes were on the future.\n\n\u201cHe kept reminding us that it is a wide and ever-changing world of technology, and as new professionals we should look carefully at new developments and see if we can use them to our advantage,\u201d says Cole, who has carried that message with him throughout his storied career at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loc.gov\/\">Library of Congress<\/a> \u2013 a grand institution undergoing profound changes in the age of digitization.\n\nHistory buffs who once shuffled through enormous card catalog files can now, in a click, access everything from 19th-century baseball cards and Civil War tunes to presidential papers without ever stepping foot in the library\u2019s reading rooms. Those rooms may be emptier now, but the library\u2019s website is hopping, constantly bringing in new audiences of educators, students, scholars, and others.\n\n\u201cWhen we started sharing materials online, it transformed the opportunities of our library users and changed the way the Library of Congress is oriented,\u201d says Cole, one of a number of iSchool alumni in leadership positions who have helped guide the institution in the electronic era.\n\nCole has dedicated almost half a century of service to the library, passionately promoting reading and literacy as Founding Director of its Center for the Book. He has used lectures, conferences, symposia, publications \u2013 even that provocative medium of television \u2013 to get his message across. He plays a key role in the library\u2019s National Book Festival, which attracts more than 80,000 visitors, and chairs its Literacy Award program. He is also the library\u2019s leading historian, with a doctorate in American civilization from Georgetown University.\n\nCole was one of two outstanding graduates nominated for a Library of Congress management internship by leaders at the UW school in 1966, when libraries were just beginning to explore automating operations and the new field of \u201cmedia studies.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven then, people at the iSchool had the foresight to see what was happening in the field,\u201d he says.\n\nThe other top graduate chosen for an internship was <strong>Mary Levering<\/strong>, \u201966, who would spend 45 years in key positions at the nation\u2019s library, putting to use problem-solving skills honed at the UW school. Her responsibilities ranged from directing legal research for the institution\u2019s massive Law Library of Congress to reviewing materials for the Congressional Research Service, which prepares background reports on pressing issues for legislators.\n\n\u201cWe would read everything produced by CRS analysts to make sure it was unbiased, non-partisan, well-researched and documented, and understandable by a reasonably educated lay person,\u201d says Levering. Some of the studies ran 200 pages \u2014 \u201cand we never missed a deadline.\u201d\n\nIn the 1990s, she traveled the country as a senior manager of the U.S. Copyright Office, which is part of the Library of Congress and the source of much of its deposited material.\n\n\u201cThe copyright world was grappling with implications of the Internet at the time,\u201d says Levering, who holds a J.D. from the Georgetown University Law Center. \u201cI was helping to develop fair-use guidelines for using copyrighted works in digital form.\u201d\n\nLevering retired in 2011 with a big-picture perspective of what is now the world\u2019s largest library, overseen by a staff of more than 3,000.\n\n\u201cThe Library of Congress is an enormously important institution. This is our national repository, the repository of our culture, our history, our literature \u2013 one of the most important cultural centers of our patrimony,\u201d says Levering, who, like Cole, is a Distinguished Alumni of the iSchool.\n\nShe describes the Library of Congress\u2019 collections as \u201crich and magnificent.\u201d On average 15,000 items pour in each working day, from maps and music to movies and manuscripts from around the world. \u00a0Library staff sorts and sifts and adds approximately 12,000 of those items to permanent collections before the next day\u2019s deluge.\n\nKeeping the behemoth institution apace with ever-advancing technology has been a formidable challenge. Government watchdogs have recently criticized its top leader, retiring Librarian of Congress James Billington, for letting it lag behind in technological areas, including digitization of its more than 30 million books. First priority for digitization has been rare manuscripts, maps, and images.\n\n\u201cI think the library is struggling with the rate at which technology is changing and keeping up with the enormity of its collections,\u201d says <strong>Jennifer Gonzalez<\/strong>, \u201913, a legal information analyst at the Law Library of Congress. \u201cFor me, working with digital collections, it is exciting to work on creating some of the solutions to these challenges.\u201d\n\nThe Library of Congress dates back to 1800, when Congress first founded it as a research arm in the Capitol building. In 1814, British troops burned that stately building to the ground, destroying the library\u2019s volumes. An almost destitute Thomas Jefferson offered up his personal 6,487-book library \u2014 more than twice the size of the original collection, with an added international focus \u2014 as a replacement, and Congress snagged it for $23,950.\n\n\u201cHis library was comprehensive,\u201d says Cole. \u201cPeople eventually realized it could be used not only for Congressional reference, but also as a great base for a national people\u2019s library.\u201d\n\nTwo centuries years later, that national people\u2019s library has grown into an international people\u2019s library \u2014 the world\u2019s largest. It has offices everywhere from Islamabad to Nairobi dedicated to acquiring materials in almost 500 different languages.\n\n<strong>Michael Neubert<\/strong>, \u201990, can attest to the reach of the library\u2019s international expansions. His 25 years at the Library of Congress include stints directing the Cairo acquisitions office, establishing library exchanges in three newly independent countries of the former Soviet Union, and helping train librarians in Iraq.\n\nNeubert began his career at the Library of Congress in 1990 as a reference librarian specializing in Russian language collection development. For more than 10 years, the Soviet studies scholar personally reviewed the bulk of Russian monographs coming into the institution. He, too, had been selected by the UW library school for a prestigious Library of Congress internship.\n\n\u201cHaving completed my master\u2019s degree, I felt I had a particularly well-informed point of view about the role of libraries in society that was more helpful in day-to-day work than I would have guessed.\u201d\n\nThe public Internet was still in its fitful infancy when Neubert arrived in 1990, a year before the debut of the World Wide Web.\n\n\u201cIn essence most of what I work on now didn\u2019t exist,\u201d he says.\n\nHis official title today is Supervisory Digital Projects Specialist in the Collections and Services Directorate. He spends part of his time coordinating digital conversion projects and the other overseeing the hands-on archiving of websites to add to permanent collections. His team captures website content from around the globe, terabyte by terabyte.\n\n\u201cWe have prioritized certain areas, such as national election campaign sites, sites of the legislative branch of the federal government, or sites of noted think tanks and organizations influencing public policy,\u201d says Neubert.\n\nHarvesting is comprehensive, right down to the Facebook page of a here-and-gone campaign opponent in a Congressional election. \u00a0\u201cFor campaign websites, we don\u2019t assess the sites, we just crawl them,\u201d says Neubert. \u201cThe challenge is in finding them all.\u201d\n\nGonzalez\u2019s research focuses on one site. She is web editor for the Law Library of Congress, in addition to working as legal information analyst and digitization coordinator. She champions the easy download. \u201cI work behind the scenes to keep our content user-friendly in searches.\u201d\n\nGonzalez graduated from the iSchool with a certificate from its Law Librarianship program \u2013 a program ranked No. 1 in the country by <em>U.S. News and World Report<\/em>. She also holds a J.D. from Pace University School of Law. The iSchool, she says, gave her a broad grounding in librarianship that serves her well.\n\n\u201cThe Library of Congress is an enormous institution and my iSchool training enables me to understand and engage with the wide range of colleagues here.\u201d\n\nShe has been at her Law Library job for two years and remains staggered by the scale of this 2.65-million-volume institution within an institution.\n\n\u201cThe Law Library is the largest in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cOver half the books are in foreign languages. We have specialists writing about every jurisdiction in the world.\u201d\n\nOne of her first big projects there was putting American Indian legal materials online, including constitutions and charters signed with Indians dating back to 1810. Many are in original native languages.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to put the collection online so that Indian nations would have access to these laws,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting collection.\u201d\n\nThe next project is to finish putting online all of America\u2019s historic treaties and statutes.\n\n\u201cI am thrilled,\u201d says Gonzalez, \u201cto be part of making U.S. laws freely and easily accessible to the world.\u201d\n\nHer advice for future information school graduates considering working at the nation\u2019s most prestigious library is to stay flexible. Know technology, but master traditional librarianship skills.\n\n\u201cOne is essential to understanding the present and future, the other to understanding the past and the present.\u201d"},{"title":"Science for the people: research funding revolutionized","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/science-for-the-people-research-funding-revolutionized\/","tags":["alumni","arts-sciences"],"pillars":["innovation"],"image":"","excerpt":"Meet Denny Luan, '11, and Cindy Wu, '11, creators of Experiment, a platform for scientists to generate crowd-sourced funding and for the public to give directly to research that matters to them.","content":"(UWAA, February 2015)\n<h2>Northern California Huskies<\/h2>\nWhen it comes to science, today\u2019s society is positioned to expand and innovate research more than ever before. However, despite our technological and intellectual advancements, one major hurdle still exists: funding. It\u2019s difficult for new ideas to take off and for researchers at early stages in their careers to access the support they need to actualize their ideas.\n\nDenny Luan,\u201911 and Cindy Wu, \u201911, are changing this through <a href=\"https:\/\/experiment.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Experiment<\/a>, a platform they created in 2012 for scientists to generate crowd-sourced funding and for the public to give directly to scientific research that matters to them.\n\nLuan and Wu came up with the idea for Experiment while students at the UW.

In 2013 they moved to the Bay area to participate in Y Combinator, a Mountain View-based incubator program for early-stage startups. After relocating to California, they both knew it was the perfect place to build Experiment.\n\n\"There is such a dynamic and growing science startup scene in San Francisco, and we wanted to be a part of it,\u201d says Luan. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond biotech, it\u2019s people changing not just the way that science is being done but also how it\u2019s being thought about and supported.\u201d\n\nLuan and Wu\u2019s work with Experiment is playing a major role in that transformation. Since they started crowdsourcing scientific research in 2012, their start-up has funded more than 250 research projects, raising more than $1.4 million in pledges. Experiment\u2019s staff of seven has partnered with 90% of the top 100 U.S. research institutions. Luan says that they receive regular requests to expand their services globally, something they hope to do soon.\n\nBoth Luan and Wu were planning on going to graduate school to pursue advanced degrees in the sciences before Experiment. Now they understand their role in the scientific community in a different way\u2014one that they feel has broader impact. \u201cOne of the most rewarding parts for me about Experiment is that I get to do research by proxy,\u201d Luan says. \u201cI get to be involved in a diverse array of research through the people we work with, and I get to help them by making it possible for others to support their work.\u201d\n\nAnd they\u2019re not the only ones who understand the work they\u2019re doing in this light.

For <strong>Hongzhe (Benji) Liang<\/strong>, \u201915, the answer is easy: Room 10, the small computer lab in the School of Art used by photomedia students. For Liang, room 10 is where he learned to take pictures, made his first video, discovered a community of artists and met some of his best friends.\n\nUpon arriving in Seattle, Liang participated in the UW <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fiuts.org\/\">FIUTS<\/a> (the Foundation for International Understanding Through Students) homestay program. He developed a meaningful relationship with the Seattle host family with whom he lived for a week before classes began. But once he moved onto campus, he had a different experience: \u201cI came to the UW by myself\u2014I didn\u2019t work with an agency like other Chinese students did, and I didn\u2019t know anyone from China who was going to attend school here.\u201d He had a difficult time connecting with other students and often felt bored during his freshman year.Liang hadn\u2019t expected to study in the U.S., but his parents wanted him to attend an American university. Immediately after finishing his high school exams, Liang\u2019s father arranged for him to move from his hometown of Yueyang to Beijing and participate in an immersive two-month English language-learning program provided through New Oriental. After completing it, Liang remained in Beijing, worked on his visa and college applications, and continued to practice English on his own. Since he had received good grades in math, he decided to focus on American schools\u00a0that had strong math programs. UW was one, so he applied and was accepted.\n\nAfter trying to get involved with a few clubs, but not feeling that he fit with any of them, Liang decided to take a photography course. His father had given him a DSLR camera as a gift for\u00a0getting accepted to college. Liang hoped the class would teach him how to use his new camera.\n\nThat class, he says, changed everything for him.\n\nHe studied photography basics and was introduced to other equipment\u2014printers, computers and software programs. He learned about technique, lighting and how to use a darkroom. And he met people who shared his newfound interest. Encouraged by his fellow students, Liang decided to enroll in a second photography course after the first ended. And then another. \u201cI just kept learning more and making friends,\u201d he says.\n\nLiang loved photography and struggled with how to continue taking classes offered through the <a href=\"http:\/\/art.washington.edu\/art\/undergraduate2\/photomedia\/about-photomedia\/\">School of Art\u2019s photomedia program<\/a> while majoring in math, as his parents expected him. For a time he tried to double-major in math and photomedia but eventually came to a realization: he wanted to devote himself to studying and making art.\n\n\u201cThis was the first major decision about my life that I\u2019d ever really made for myself,\u201d he recalls. He was nervous to tell his father and even hid it from him for a while. He remembers, \u201cMy dad was upset when he finally found out, but my decision felt like the right path for me, and I couldn\u2019t let it go.\u201d As Liang pursued his studies, he updated his dad about everything: his excitement with the new material he was learning, examples of his photos and video projects, invitations he accepted to display his work in art shows and on websites, scholarships he received and awards for which he was nominated (such as the School of Art\u2019s Louis and Katherine March Scholarship and the Parnassus Graduate with Excellence Award). Eventually, his father began to accept\u2014and support\u2014his son\u2019s decision.\n\nAt the UW, Liang also gained another valuable skillset: job skills. A graduating friend was leaving a part-time job as a student videographer for the UW\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/simpsoncenter.org\/\">Simpson Center for the Humanities<\/a> and suggested that Liang apply for it. He had never applied for a job before, so he wrote his first resume and cover letter. His classmates helped him practice for the interview.\n\nBeing at the Simpson Center helped Liang\u00a0understand the difference between creating art projects and work projects: \u201cMost of the art I make is for myself\u2014I can explore what I want to explore\u2014but there were many different factors that shaped the stories we told through video projects at the Simpson Center, and it was good for me to gain experience collaborating with supervisors as well as scholars outside of my program.\u201d He adds that working taught him the value of time management and being responsible for his own money\u2014skills from which he will greatly benefit now that he has graduated.\n\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em\">Liang did not make art when he lived in China, and his first trip home was three years after he\u2019d been in Seattle. \u201cI wanted to reflect on the culture and place in which I grew up, but I realized that I didn\u2019t know it in the same way as I thought I did,\u201d he recalls. He describes the experience as \u201creverse culture shock\u201d\u2014a feeling that has stuck with him and is something he often thinks about when creating art projects, no matter the medium (he now works with videography and installations as well as photography). \u201cIt\u2019s been an interesting process for me,\u201d he says, \u201cThe more work I make, the more I go back in time\u2014to revisit, ask why, rethink and question.\u201d<\/span>More than anything, though, Liang credits the photomedia program with helping him develop the critical thinking skills necessary for personal and artistic growth. \u201cIt is a conceptually heavy program,\u201d he says. \u201cThe more time I spent in it, the more I began to question things\u2014both art and life. I felt myself shift\u2014I started thinking more and asking questions <em>before<\/em> acting or simply accepting answers.\u201d\n\nLiang plans to go to graduate school for art but wants to make sure he finds the right fit\u2014for himself. He hopes to stay in Seattle and develop deeper relationships in the local art community while he researches artist residencies and graduate programs.\n\nAbove all, he\u00a0is grateful for the personal growth he underwent and friends he made at the UW. \u201cIt\u2019s important to discover how to make the opportunity to study in the U.S. your own\u2014how to be honest with yourself and shape it into a meaningful experience for you,\u201d he says.\n\nVisit <a href=\"http:\/\/lianghongzhe.com\/\">Liang\u2019s website<\/a> to see more of his\u00a0work."},{"title":"Advocating for equal access","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/advocating-for-equal-access\/","tags":["arts-sciences","giving","school-of-medicine","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"With a passion for equity, sophomore Joshua Dawson is advocating for \u2014 and empowering \u2014 underrepresented\npre-med students.","content":"(Homepage, September 2015)\n\nFor students across the country, applying to medical school can be one of the most daunting tasks of their collegiate careers. But for some applicants, especially underrepresented minorities or students from underserved backgrounds, the most difficult part of that process can be completing the shadowing hours \u2014 time spent observing doctor-patient interactions \u2014 recommended by many medical schools, including the University of Washington.\n\nSeeing an opportunity to make a difference, Dawson and two peers decided to do something innovative: pioneer an online database for pre-med students to connect and network with practicing doctors. Together, they\u2019re increasing access to careers in health care for countless students in the greater Seattle area.\u201cConnecting with physicians is not the easiest thing to do when you personally do not know any,\u201d says Joshua Dawson, a sophomore studying molecular and cellular biology at the UW and a hopeful future physician. \u201cIt can be really hard to navigate the system.\u201d\n\nDawson and fellow sophomore Yarid Mera first came up with the idea for the shadowing project during a meeting with the dean of admissions at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.uwmedicine.org\/education\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UW School of Medicine<\/a>. Learning about a program in Walla Walla that matched college students with physicians, Dawson and Mera, along with Jawwad Ali, another UW student, realized the immense impact a similar program could have in Seattle.\n\nIn collaboration with the <a href=\"http:\/\/kcmsociety.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">King County Medical Society<\/a>, they set to work implementing a database to provide undergraduates the required shadowing hours through online networking. Area physicians and hospitals quickly got on board, and students from universities across the region have already expressed interest in the budding program.\n\nDawson\u2019s spirit of service was instilled early on. Finding \u201cfamily away from home\u201d at his high school in Federal Way, Washington \u2014 where about 60 percent of his classmates qualified for free or reduced lunch \u2014 Dawson recognized that his community gave him purpose for his studies, and empowered him to give back. He also was motivated by his family; despite facing financial difficulties, Dawson\u2019s parents taught him that all doors were open to him \u2014 if he was willing to pursue them.\n\nBy the start of his freshman year at the UW, Dawson was raring to help his new community. His ambition and academic merits had earned him a prestigious Gates Millennium Scholarship and a Costco Scholarship, and, inspired by the boundless opportunities the scholarships afforded him, Dawson sought to help other Huskies feel empowered.

As a teenager, he was an offensive lineman on four state championship teams at Bellevue High School. The son of an All-American UW track star and grandson of a UW football player, he has Husky athletics in his DNA, so once he made the Husky football team, one of his greatest dreams seemed to have come true. But one big question remained: How would he be able to make attending the UW happen financially?\n\nNow a senior majoring in communication and an offensive lineman on the football team, Kneip is committed to leaving behind a legacy of his own \u2014 on the football field and in the community. During the school year, his days are long. Grueling football workouts typically run from 7 to 11 a.m. Then, it\u2019s on to the day\u2019s classes, tutoring and, finally, meetings or film study. But despite this ever-packed schedule, Kneip still finds time to fuel his other passion: philanthropy.Helping turn his childhood dream into a reality was the Chase Anderson Endowed Scholarship, which went toward tuition and additional educational expenses that exceeded his financial aid package \u2014 and inspired him to continue helping others. \u201cThis is where I dreamed of playing as a kid, but if I want to play football, I don\u2019t have any time to work,\u201d he says. \u201cThis scholarship opened up an amazing door for me.\u201d\n\nIt started in 2008. The recession hit Kneip\u2019s parents, a handyman and a real estate agent, especially hard. But as their financial difficulties compounded, the Kneip family banded together to help others. \u201cEven though we didn\u2019t have much money,\u201d he says, \u201cwe knew we could definitely help people in situations like ours.\u201d\n\nIn addition to starting a Thanksgiving food drive, Kneip\u2019s mother began making and delivering sandwiches to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ugm.org\/\">Union Gospel Mission<\/a> in downtown Seattle. Soon, Kneip became involved, learning lessons that shaped the person he is today. \u201cGiving puts life in perspective for you,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery time I volunteered, I\u2019d meet someone different. You can\u2019t generalize people based on their financial background. It\u2019s more about the person and the spirit behind them.\u201d\n\nToday, along with a rotating cast of his friends and fellow athletes, Kneip makes over a hundred sandwiches every week for the Union Gospel Mission. \u201cEveryone loves doing it. There are never enough donations there, so we challenge ourselves to make more and more,\u201d he says.\n\nKneip has also broadened his philanthropic scope, especially through his ties to the UW football team. Some of his favorite memories involve visiting local elementary schools and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seattlechildrens.org\/\">Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital<\/a> with his teammates, and he\u2019s recently co-founded the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.upliftingathletes.org\/ua-chapter\/washington\">UW branch of Uplifting Athletes<\/a>, a national nonprofit that raises money for rare diseases. This season, through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cQ0G1etwSlo\">fundraising events<\/a> like touchdown drives, Kneip looks forward to rallying his teammates to raise money for pediatric multiple sclerosis.\n\n\u201cThere are so many people who watch Husky football, and we\u2019re using it as a platform,\u201d he says. \u201cTo be part of the program here and to have the opportunity to help others by playing the sport we love is really special to us.\u201d\n\nKneip has two seasons left with the Huskies, and he\u2019s hard at work making sure he finishes strong. But sometimes, he points out, it\u2019s not necessarily about finishing something by yourself \u2014 it\u2019s about laying the groundwork and leaving behind a legacy that will give others the tools, and inspiration, to carry on.\n<h3>Chase Anderson Endowed Scholarship<\/h3>\nThe Chase Anderson Endowed Scholarship honors the life of UW student and Bellevue High School graduate Chase Anderson, who died suddenly in 2008. In response to this unexpected tragedy, family and friends of Anderson came together in a touching show of support, donating generously and establishing a fund that honors his name.\n\nPart of the UW\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/huskypromise\/\">Husky Promise<\/a>, the Chase Anderson Endowed Scholarship provides funding beyond what is covered by state and federal funds, closing the financial gap for students of great need.\n\nMichael Kneip is grateful for the scholarship because it makes living his childhood dream a reality. But for him, it\u2019s a little more personal. His older sisters were friends with Anderson, and Kneip always held him in high esteem as an inspiring role model.\n\n\u201cChase had this awesome spirit about him,\u201d says Kneip. \u201cI always looked up to him as a kid, and I always wanted to carry myself like him when I was older.\u201d\n<h2>Explore the UW<\/h2>\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/huskypromise\/\">The Husky Promise<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/giving\/\">Giving opportunities<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gohuskies.com\/\">Husky Athletics<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>"},{"title":"Hungry for change","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/hungry-for-change\/","tags":["college-of-education","graduate-student"],"pillars":["innovation"],"image":"","excerpt":"Christine Tran, a Ph.D. student in the College of Education, is peeling back the complex issues surrounding hunger in our nation\u2019s schools.","content":"(Homepage, August 2015)\n\nWhen Christine Tran was a new teacher in Los Angeles, the most significant hurdle to her students\u2019 learning was one that she hadn\u2019t expected: hunger. Although almost all of her students qualified for free school lunch, a majority refused to eat it.\n\u201cSome students talk about school food like it\u2019s that \u2018Simpsons\u2019 mystery meat,\u201d she says, and they skip lunch or eat junk food instead. And then there\u2019s social stigma: In many schools, students call it \u201cprison food\u201d \u2014 a nod, in some cases, to personal experiences, friends or family members who have actually been to prison. At Tran\u2019s school, bullies would often make fun of students who ate school lunch until they, too, stopped eating, preferring hunger to ridicule.\u00a0Why?\n\nAll of this surprised Tran, because she had a very different experience when she grew up, a low-income student herself. The daughter of Vietnamese refugees, Tran was a self-professed \u201cfree-lunch kid.\u201d Free meals and other social policies had helped her on her path to success, but why were they failing her students?\n\nToday, she is trying to get to the heart of this question as a UW Ph.D. candidate in the College of Education, with a focus on educational policy, organizations and leadership. Her goal: to close the gap between policy and practice.\n\nTran is working with UW faculty and graduate students from disciplines as diverse as social work, museology and public health, immersing herself in mixed-method research that is helping her untangle such a complex issue. \u201cHow does everything fit, and how can we work together to address the disparities in the system?\u201d she asks. \u201cI can\u2019t separate good food and good education. In order to have both, we need to talk about both.\u201d\n\nOne reason Tran came to the UW was the abundance of opportunities to connect children to nutrition and a sense of community: integral pieces of the puzzle. She supplements her education by volunteering as an educational leader at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pikeplacemarket.org\/education\">Pike Place Market Education Program<\/a>, where she teaches local schoolchildren about community history, social services, small businesses, local agriculture and diverse foods.\n\n\u201cMy friends joke that Pike Place Market is my graduate minor,\u201d she says. \u201cI think they\u2019re right. It\u2019s so much of a part of my educational experience. Reconnecting with kids reminds me why I\u2019m doing all of this to begin with.\u201d\n\nTran\u2019s hard work is paying off, earning her several fellowships and even the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hungercenter.org\/news-events\/awards\/2015-awards-ceremony\/\">Congressional Hunger Center Alumni Leadership Award<\/a>, which she recently traveled to Washington, D.C., to accept. She is happy with the publicity she gets, she says, but only because it helps others understand and care about an issue that is so important to her.\n\nA teacher at heart, she is a natural at finding ways to help others understand the importance of her mission. She recalls a time years ago when she worked at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.latinopolicyforum.org\/\">Latino Policy Forum<\/a> in Chicago and was at a career fair, trying to explain policy work to schoolchildren. She used an analogy:\n\n\u201cHave you ever played a game that was unfair, that you always lose?\u201d\n\nThe kids had. Not surprisingly, they didn\u2019t like losing.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what policy is about,\u201d said Tran. \u201cIt\u2019s about changing the rules of the game so that everyone can win.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Explore the UW<\/h2>\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/education.uw.edu\/\">College of Education<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>"},{"title":"Powering promise","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/powering-promise\/","tags":["engineering","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["innovation"],"image":"","excerpt":"Combining a background in electrical engineering with the real-life business skills she\u2019s learning with the UW Solar club, Shruti Misra is helping make solar power a reality at the UW and beyond.","content":"(Homepage, August 2015)\n\nShruti Misra often spends hours on end mired in small details: variables in complex equations that explain currents and voltage, lines and lines of computer code, kilowatts, square footage and price points.

Misra is also busy working on a web interface for the data the panels submit, which she\u2019s never done before.

Through the club, Misra is gaining hands-on experience managing projects that will have a direct impact on sustainable energy use on campus and in buildings owned by UW Real Estate. Though UW Solar is overseen by graduate students and faculty, undergraduates run the show: \u201cI like the fact that you get to <em>do<\/em> these projects instead of just watching,\u201d Misra says. \u201cBasically, we are like a consulting firm.

Meeting regularly with other students involved in UW Solar, Misra talks planning, finance, engineering, architecture and more. And then, as project lead, she pulls together all the information into in-depth proposals that detail different types of solar panels, layouts and estimated cost and energy savings.\n\n\u201cI like sitting down and discussing ideas, figuring out how to get projects done,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore joining UW Solar, I had no project management experience, but now, I might even focus my career on it.\u201d\n\nNext year, Misra hopes to wrap up the Agua Verde project, but UW Solar continues to grow: The club has finalized talks to help install panels for the West Campus Utility Plant and is discussing several potential projects on and around campus.\n\nEven when Misra and her peers graduate, the solar panels they\u2019ve helped install will remain visible reminders of their hard work and collaboration in the past, the present shift to clean, renewable energy and a future that is, well, bright.\n<h2>UW Solar<\/h2>\nFormed three years ago as handful of mostly graduate students, UW Solar became well known on campus after its first project \u2014 installing 128 solar panels on the roof of Mercer Court\u2019s A Building in April 2014.

The big picture is something that\u2019s always on his mind, which is reflected in both his art and science. As a photographer, he captures sweeping scenes, from giant, rippling cloud masses and never-ending skies, to massive, bobbing icebergs in a vast ocean. As a scientist who studies paleoclimatology, he asks questions on a sweeping scale to untangle the complexities of the Earth\u2019s climate history over millennia.\n\nMarkle, who is pursuing a Ph.D. in the College of the Environment\u2019s Department of Earth and Space Sciences, studies the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide, a U.S.-led deep ice-coring project funded by the National Science Foundation.

Researchers across the globe are working in tandem to analyze and interpret various data from the WAIS Divide. Markle, a native Oregonian, is one of those scientists.

Results show that over the past decade, ivory has largely come from just two areas in Africa \u2013 one each for the forest and savanna elephants. The findings are published online June 18 in the journal Science.\nWasser previously used DNA from elephant dung, tissue and hair collected across the African continent to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/101\/41\/14847.short\">map<\/a> genetic signatures for regional populations. He then developed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nprot\/journal\/v2\/n9\/abs\/nprot.2007.318.html\">methods<\/a> to extract DNA from the ivory, allowing him to analyze seized contraband and determine the elephant\u2019s original population.\u201cAfrica is a huge continent, and poaching is occurring everywhere. When you look at it that way it seems like a daunting task to tackle this problem,\u201d Wasser said. \u201cBut when you look at large ivory seizures, which represent 70 percent of illegal ivory by weight, you get a different picture.\u201d\n\nRoughly 50,000 African elephants are now being killed each year from a population of fewer than 500,000 animals. Poaching is driving these iconic animals toward extinction, said Wasser, a UW research professor of biology who directs the UW <a href=\"http:\/\/conservationbiology.uw.edu\/\">Center for Conservation Biology<\/a>.\n\nKnowing the primary areas where elephants are poached could help combat ivory trafficking at its source.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding that vast amounts of this major transnational trade is focused on two primary areas makes it possible to focus law enforcement on those areas and eliminate the largest amount of illegal killing,\u201d Wasser said.\n\nHis lab has been getting ivory samples, roughly half-dollar shaped disks from near the base of the tusk, since 2005. The number of seizures sent to his lab has greatly increased since 2013, when an international body unanimously <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/wildlife-trade-meeting-en\/\">decided<\/a> that all large shipments of seized ivory should be subjected to forensic DNA testing to pinpoint their origin. These large shipments are associated with major transnational organized crime syndicates, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newscientist.com\/article\/mg22229692.700-ivory-poaching-funds-most-war-and-terrorism-in-africa.html\">profits<\/a> have been tied to the funding of African terrorist organizations.\n\nIn the new paper, the UW group used its method to analyze 28 large ivory seizures, each more than half a ton, made between 1996 and 2014. The samples include 61 percent of all large seizures made worldwide between 2012 and 2014.\n\nAll but one of the 28 seizures were concentrated in only four areas. Most seizures made since 2006, the new paper reports, were concentrated in just two areas.\n\nThe analysis shows that:\n<ul>\n\t<li>More than 85 percent of the forest elephant ivory seized between 2006 and 2014 was traced to the central African <a href=\"http:\/\/wwf-congobasin.org\/where_we_work\/gabon\/tridom_programme\/\">Tridom protected ecosystem<\/a> that spans northeastern Gabon, northwestern Republic of Congo and southeastern Cameroon, and the adjacent reserve in southwestern Central African Republic.<\/li>\n\t<li>More than 85 percent of the savanna elephant ivory seized between 2006 and 2014 was traced to East Africa, mainly from the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Selous_Game_Reserve\">Selous Game Reserve<\/a> in southeastern Tanzania and the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Niassa_Reserve\">Niassa Reserve<\/a> in adjacent northern Mozambique.<\/li>\n\t<li>In 2011 the savanna elephant hotspot began shifting northward, from southeastern Tanzania toward the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ruaha_National_Park\">Ruaha National Park<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rungwa_Game_Reserve\">Rungwa Game Reserve<\/a> in the country\u2019s center, gradually creeping northward toward Kenya.<\/li>\n\t<li>The few seizures that did not fit the dominant geographic pattern showed other unusual signs, such as more complicated shipping strategies and a broader distribution of tusks.<\/li>\n\t<li>One of the biggest seizures contained large amounts of ivory from both hotspots, suggesting a link between the major dealers operating in these two areas.<\/li>\n\t<li>Of the 28 total seizures, 23 were genetically assigned to a different main country of origin than the country from which they were being shipped.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThe investigations show a shift in poaching hotspots beginning in 2006. During the earlier years, 1996-2005, most forest elephant ivory Wasser analyzed was assigned to eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, but none of the forest elephant samples after 2005 came from that area. Two seizures of savanna elephant ivory, in 2002 and 2007, came from Zambia, but the country was not represented in any of the samples after 2007.\n\nRecent efforts to curb trafficking have focused on curbing demand, but Wasser believes that process happens too slowly.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re losing a tenth of the population a year, you have to do something more urgent \u2013 nail down where the major killing is happening and stop it at the source,\u201d Wasser said. \u201cHopefully our results will force the primary source countries to accept more responsibility for their part in this illegal trade, encourage the international community to work closely with these countries to contain the poaching, and these actions will choke the criminal networks that enable this transnational organized crime to operate.\u201d\n\nCo-authors are <a href=\"http:\/\/conservationbiology.uw.edu\/about-us\/staff-and-student\/\">Celia Mailand<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biology.washington.edu\/news\/post-doc-samrat-mondol-awarded-indias-inspire-faculty-fellowship\">Samrat Mondol<\/a> in UW biology; <a href=\"http:\/\/students.washington.edu\/lisab155\/new%20index.html\">Lisa Brown<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pub\/cathy-laurie\/0\/351\/85\">Cathy Laurie<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gs.washington.edu\/faculty\/weir.htm\">Bruce Weir<\/a> in UW biostatistics; and William Clark at INTERPOL.\n\nThe research was funded by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Leonard X.

They also will undertake their own self-directed science and outreach projects that will continue through the fall.\n\nThe group is posting daily news updates on the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/interactiveoceans.washington.edu\/story\/VISIONS_15\">cruise website<\/a>, which includes <a href=\"http:\/\/interactiveoceans.washington.edu\/story\/VISIONS_15_Images\">photos<\/a> and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/interactiveoceans.washington.edu\/story\/Student_Blogs_VISIONS15\">student blog posts<\/a>.

This year is the first annual cruise to maintain the observatory, which will continue to gather data about climate change, marine chemistry, deep-sea life and seismic activity for a quarter of a century.\n\u201cThe cabled observatory allows us to put equipment from high-tech labs at the bottom of the ocean,\u201d said <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ocean.washington.edu\/home\/Deborah+Kelley\">Deborah Kelley<\/a>, a UW professor of oceanography who is at sea for the cruise. \u201cIt really gives us eyes that we\u2019ve never had before.\u201d\n\nThe cruise has been going well, she said, thanks to the work of the team at sea and on shore, and the energy and enthusiasm of the students.\n\nKhadijah Homolka, a UW Earth and space sciences student who participated in the first of the three legs, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.interactiveoceans.washington.edu\/story\/Kadijah_Homolkas_Blog\">wrote from the ship<\/a> in July about getting used to the ship\u2019s motion, mistakenly sitting in the captain\u2019s chair, working on marine science instruments and getting ready for her 4 a.m. shift logging the operations of the deep-sea robot.\n\n\u201cIt is a little intimidating, but it\u2019s often the nerve-wracking experiences that turn out to be the most memorable ones,\u201d Homolka wrote. \u201cI\u2019m currently in the open ocean, an incredibly hostile and fickle environment, so why not try something a little scary?\u201d\n\nThis summer\u2019s work includes swapping out three refrigerator-sized \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/news\/2014\/03\/13\/tethered-robots-tested-for-internet-connected-ocean-observatory\/\">science pods<\/a>\u201d designed and built at the UW <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apl.uw.edu\/\">Applied Physics Laboratory<\/a>. These 200-pound pods require annual maintenance to let them zoom up and down through 600 feet of water collecting data nonstop. The team will also install three <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/news\/2014\/03\/13\/tethered-robots-tested-for-internet-connected-ocean-observatory\/\">deep-ocean profilers<\/a> to patrol the deeper depths.\n\nThe full 35-day itinerary includes checking each of the Cabled Array study sites. These range from an active underwater volcano and scalding-hot vents to seafloor deposits leaking methane gases closer to shore, and a site where the shallower coastal ocean drops off into the open sea. The ship will come ashore in Oregon briefly July 19-20 to swap crews and load new equipment.\n\nSo far, preliminary data is available on the seismic activity, pressure and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pmel.noaa.gov\/eoi\/rsn\/\">seafloor movement<\/a> at the volcanic site. The interface that will publicly display all the data streaming in from the observatory is <a href=\"http:\/\/oceanobservatories.org\/ooi-construction-and-data-status-update-june-16-2015\/\">nearing completion<\/a> and is scheduled to launch by the end of the year.Meanwhile, other team members are watching from the UW campus. The ship lowers the tethered robot down nearly two miles beneath the ocean\u2019s surface to plug in equipment. As soon as that equipment connects to the cable, it\u2019s online and data flows at the speed of light to land. The onshore team runs installation and checks to make any adjustments before the robot\u2019s work is complete.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDeborah Kelley is also spearheading a new collaboration to help Washington high school classes build and deploy their own ocean sensors.

He is one of <a href=\"http:\/\/ssg.astro.washington.edu\/lsst.shtml\">several UW professors<\/a>\u00a0working on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lsst.org\/lsst\/\">Large Synoptic Survey Telescope<\/a>, or LSST, which will begin scanning the sky in 2022 from its location atop Cerro Pach\u00f3n, a mountain in northern Chile.\n\nHe has called it \u201cone of the most exciting experiments in astrophysics today,\u201d adding, \u201cit could completely transform our knowledge of the universe, from understanding how dark energy drives the expansion of the universe, to identifying asteroids that may one day impact the Earth.\u201d\n\nOver the years, Connolly has worked on a number of areas in the design and construction of the LSST, from running the UW data management group that develops software to study information that will come from the telescope, to leading a team developing simulations of what this powerful new telescope might see. On his web page he says, \u201cMy science focuses on analyzing large astronomical data sets to study the formation and evolution of galaxies and cosmology.\u201d\n\nThroughout his career he has been involved with big data projects. As a postdoctoral researcher he was involved in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sdss.org\/\">Sloan Digital Sky Survey<\/a>, or SDSS, a collaboration of about 200 astronomers at more than 40 institutions on four continents that has been scanning the sky and collecting data since 2000. During a sabbatical in 2006 at Google, Connolly was the project leader for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/sky\/\">Google Sky<\/a>, which incorporated images from the <a href=\"http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/\">Hubble Space Telescope<\/a>\u00a0and the SDSS into Google Earth.\n\nConnolly answered a few questions about his work and the promise of big data and tools such as the LSST to astronomy.\n\n<strong>Q: Where are you spending the year, and what are you working on?<\/strong>\n\n<strong>A.C.:<\/strong> I am in Cambridge (the UK version) for a year. I\u2019m working on a few different areas ranging from the detection of objects whose light has been bent (or gravitationally lensed) by distant galaxies, to studying how we can survey the sky to maximize how quickly we can get science from the LSST.\n\nThese may seem like very different questions and problems but they are in fact related. They both involve searching for subtle signals from large complex data sets. Signals that are hard to extract but if we can, we might be able to understand how the universe evolves (driven by dark energy and dark matter).\n\nWe have a lot of different ways to look at the sky (different telescopes and instruments) and many tools that can be used when working with data, but it is only when you start applying these techniques to real observations that you can understand how well they will perform in practice. I\u2019m trying to use some of the techniques that we will use on the LSST but on today\u2019s data sets.\n\nSo you could say that I am getting my hands dirty with data, which has been a lot of fun, especially with the LSST a few years away.\n\n<strong>Q: In your TED talk you say that a single image from the LSST will be equivalent to 3,000 images from the Hubble Space Telescope. How is this achieved?<\/strong>\n\n<strong>A.C.: <\/strong>The LSST isn\u2019t the biggest telescope in the world (unlike the new generation of telescopes that will have mirrors 30 meters across), nor does it have the highest-quality images (such as those from space base telescopes like the Hubble).\n\nWhat it does have is a very large field of view (one image covers an area seven times the width of the full moon) and the largest digital camera in the world (with 3.2 billion pixels). This means it can survey half of the sky every three nights to discover if anything has changed or moved (something Hubble would take about 120 years to do just once).\n\nOne of the great aspects of all of the telescopes and instruments we are building today is that they have different and complementary capabilities (e.g. the Hubble can look at great detail at very faint sources but can\u2019t cover large areas of the sky). Combined, we get to reveal both the big picture and the details of how the universe has evolved up to the present day.\n\n<strong>Q: What are the challenges that you face in order to answer these \u201cbig questions\u201d?<\/strong>\n\n<strong>A.C.:<\/strong> Within the next decade new telescopes (on Earth and in space), and new cameras and spectrographs will realize a 1,000-fold increase in the amount of data accessible to astronomers. The size of the data will enable us to answer some of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics today \u2014 questions we have been asking since we started looking up at the stars and wondering how they came into being.\n\nDiscoveries that might come from the data include:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Measurements of the shapes of distant galaxies could reveal the properties of dark energy with an accuracy 10 times better than today. This could change our understanding of general relativity if it shows that gravity works differently on large scales.<\/li>\n\t<li>Surveys of the faint radio sky may detect the epoch at which stars and galaxies first began to form within the universe.<\/li>\n\t<li>Tracking the orbits of asteroids and comets could reveal if the environment in which the Sun formed was responsible for the distribution of the planets in our solar system or identify asteroids that might one day impact the Earth (at distances where we can do something about it).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nSome of the most exciting discoveries will be answers to questions that today we don\u2019t even know how to ask.\u00a0We are reaching a stage where our data are much richer than many of the analyses we apply to them, and where software and algorithms have the potential to become the next instrument for exploring the universe.But this data-rich era comes with a big challenge: Scientific discovery is beginning to be limited not by how we collect or store data, but how we extract the knowledge it contains.\n\nFixing this gap between the science and the amount of data is something that we need to address. The increasing complexity and size of data coming from these instruments means astrophysics is becoming ever more dependent on developments in computing. It also means that there is a great opportunity for discovery if we can prepare the next generation of students and postdocs with the skills that are needed for an era rich in data.\n\n<strong>Q: You also mention that \u201cthe smart use of data\u201d and new tools will transform astronomy in coming years, \u201copening up a window in the universe \u2014 the window of time.\u201d What new understanding of the cosmos might this bring?<\/strong>\n\n<strong>A.C.:<\/strong> There are so many things we know about the universe but don\u2019t understand. We know it is expanding and this expansion is getting faster, but we don\u2019t understand what causes the acceleration.\n\nWe know that the dynamics of the universe suggest that most of the matter is not visible, but we don\u2019t understand what particles might make up that matter. We can see the diversity of stars and galaxies that have formed in the universe, but we don\u2019t understand, in detail, the physical processes that drive the formation and evolution of galaxies or the formation of the first stars.\n\nIt is a great time to be an astronomer because a new generation of telescopes and surveys might help us unlock these answers by providing a view of the universe that has unprecedented detail. Data will answer these questions (hopefully) and this revolution in data will occur over the next decade.\n<ul>\n\t<li>Visit <a href=\"http:\/\/ssg.astro.washington.edu\/lsst.shtml\">online <\/a>for more information about the UW and the LSST.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>\u201cSome of the most exciting discoveries will be answers to questions that today we don\u2019t even know how to ask.\u201d \u2013 Andrew Connolly<\/h3>"},{"title":"Back home again: UW ethnomusicologists return heritage music to its roots","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/back-home-again-uw-ethnomusicologists-return-heritage-music-to-its-roots\/","tags":["arts-sciences","faculty"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"Faculty and students\u00a0from the UW\u00a0School of Music\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/music.washington.edu\/areas\/ethnomusicology\">Ethnomusicology Program<\/a> are helping return\u00a0folk and early blues\u00a0music \u2014 collected decades ago and fading from local memory \u2014 to its birthplace, with teaching materials to explain its cultural and historical context.","content":"(News &amp; Info, June 2014)\n\nThis is a story about folk music, hill music and scratchy early blues \u2014 about guitars and banjos, fifes and flutes, and voices raised in song on sweltering back porches many years ago.\n\nAnd it\u2019s about how people from the University of Washington School of Music\u2019s \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/music.washington.edu\/areas\/ethnomusicology\">Ethnomusicology Program<\/a> are helping return some of that music \u2014 collected decades ago and fading from local memory \u2014 to its birthplace, with teaching materials to explain its cultural and historical context.\n\nThis is work for which the program is perfectly suited, blending as it does musicology and anthropology with performance studies and community engagement.\n\nBut the story really begins with a pickup truck bumping along a dusty Appalachian back road in the 1930s, with a huge tape recorder filling the back and music collector <a href=\"http:\/\/www.culturalequity.org\/alanlomax\/ce_alanlomax_bio.php\">Alan Lomax<\/a> at the wheel.\n\nHe recorded many since recognized as American music greats \u2014 Leadbelly, Jelly Roll Morton, Woody Guthrie, Muddy Waters and more. In time, the McCarthyism of the 1950s sent Lomax abroad, where he continued his work for years, and across continents.\n\nLomax, a folklorist and ethnomusicologist like his <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_Lomax\">father<\/a>, made a career of collecting and recording music where people lived, worked and worshipped. From his first independent work in the 1930s until the 1980s, Lomax explored America\u2019s Mississippi Delta and Midwest, the Appalachians, the Ozarks and eastern Kentucky, then the Caribbean, Europe and even North Africa.\n\nLomax was not the only one; producer <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Moses_Asch\">Moses Asch<\/a> also collected and published music during the same years, and later formed what was to become Folkways Records, the label that brought folk music to the American mainstream. Folkways was bought by the Smithsonian Institution in 1987 and is now <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Smithsonian_Folkways\">Smithsonian Folkways<\/a> functioning as both a recording label and an important musical archive.\n\u201cOf course, I am an old folkster,\u201d Campbell says with a smile in her charmingly cluttered campus office. \u201cThat\u2019s what I used to do a whole lot of. I played in various groups \u2014 sang, played guitar and dulcimer.\u201dIt is through the Smithsonian\u2019s ongoing work that <a href=\"https:\/\/music.washington.edu\/people\/patricia-shehan-campbell\">Patricia Campbell<\/a>, a UW professor of music, and her ethnomusicology colleagues, enter the story.\n\nOver time, Campbell transitioned from the stage to the classroom as professor of music. \u201cI work with raising musicians to teach, to do community service,\u201d she said. She shows students that even if they don\u2019t get the \u201cbig country circuit gig,\u201d they can shine as \u201ca transmitter of heritage music.\u201d\n\nEthnomusicology became her academic home, which Campbell explained is about more than just collecting songs. \u201cIt\u2019s an analysis of song, of music in culture \u2014 and of music <em>as<\/em> culture \u2014 of knowing the musicians and understanding their stories\u201d and how they express themselves through music.\n\nCampbell began working with Smithsonian Folkways, helping them get their music \u201cout of the archive and into the public sector.\u201d She now chairs the association\u2019s advisory board.\n\nTogether with doctoral students Rita Klinger (who has since passed away), Christopher Roberts and Amanda Soto, Campbell designed a special summer curriculum for school and university teachers to use the online resources of the Smithsonian-Folkways recordings and films. The course has run for six summers at the UW, and has been taught at other universities in the U.S. and in Mexico.\n\nThe two threads of the story wove together several years back when Campbell got to know\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anna_Lomax_Wood\">Anna Lomax Wood<\/a>, the only daughter of the famed folklorist, who died in 2002.\n\nWood is now president of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.culturalequity.org\/index.php\">Association for Cultural Equity<\/a> her father founded in 1983. Impressed by Campbell\u2019s work in music education, Wood asked the educator to help open the huge and historically important Lomax archives \u2014 many now at the Library of Congress \u2014 back up to the world.\n\nCampbell was thrilled \u2014 and their work of music repatriation began in earnest.\n\nShe started by creating <a href=\"http:\/\/culturalequity.org\/rc\/ce_rc_teaching.php\">lesson plans<\/a> for Lomax-collected music being repatriated to Grenada, Carriacou and Haiti, and then for Como and Senatobia, Mississippi, where repatriation ceremonies were held in 2012 and 2013.\n\nWood said, \u201cOur idea was to give people at least one viable tool for working with their music in the present. Pat\u2019s lesson plan teaches basic music \u2018theory\u2019 through folk music as it is actually performed.\u201d\n\nThere are three main repatriation projects, Campbell said, starting with the Mississippi hill country and then in rural Michigan. Come September there will be a repatriation back to East Kentucky, \u201cwhere the original \u2018House of the Rising Sun\u2019 comes from, and was recorded by Alan Lomax,\u201d Campbell noted.\n\nWood said folks at the Como, Mississippi, library \u201ctook us up on our challenge, and brought in artists to teach instrument making and playing and tried out our lesson plans.\u201d\n\nAfter the 2013 repatriation, Campbell was invited to lecture about music education at the University of Mississippi and give workshops in Oxford, Mississippi, schools \u2014 work she\u2019ll return to in the fall.\n\n\u201cPat has risen to the occasion with great enthusiasm, bringing all of her experience and her tact to the task,\u201d Wood said. \u201cShe now plays an indispensable role in our repatriation activities. We share a vision about what it means to bring music back home to its people.\u201d\n\nWho receives these repatriated materials? Whoever is best able to receive and make use of them.\n\n\u201cMuseums, community centers, church folks,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to librarians, the local mayor and council. And the families will be invited to a big ceremony where we share some of the recordings.\u201d\n\nAt the Mississippi repatriation ceremony last fall, family members of artists recorded long ago stepped forward with pride.\n\n\u201cIt was magic in the room,\u201d Campbell said.\n\nSo many years have passed since Alan Lomax traveled dusty back roads across states and continents, many have forgotten about the music their own ancestors created.\n\n\u201cA lot of folks are decades removed from it, can\u2019t even imagine what it might have been like,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThey\u2019ve moved off the back porches, where there was no air conditioning, and they used to sit out there playing a banjo, or a fiddle or something.\u201d\n\nCampbell knows she can\u2019t return this old music to its former glory. But she also believes, as Alan Lomax did, that \u201cwe can understand Americans \u2014 citizens of the world \u2014 through the songs they sing, the instruments they play and their dances.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd,\u201d she said, \u201cwho knows what will come of it?\u201d\n\n<strong>Learn more about music repatriation and Alan Lomax:<\/strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.culturalequity.org\/ace\/repatriations\/MS\/index.php\">Read about the UW and Association for Cultural Equity\u2019s October 2013 music repatriation in Como, Mississippi.<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.culturalequity.org\/alanlomax\/ce_alanlomax_index.php\">Read Anna Lomax Wood\u2019s essay about her father, folklorist Alan Lomax.<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.johnszwed.com\/\">Writer John Szwed published the biography \u201cAlan Lomax: The Man Who Recorded the World\u201d in 2010.<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FBMmvGYmiRI\">Hear the Alan Lomax recording of Georgia Turner singing \u201cHouse of the Rising Sun.\u201d<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>"},{"title":"Online \u2018Legislative Explorer\u2019 uses big data to track decades of lawmaking","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/legislative-explorer\/","tags":["arts-sciences","faculty","graduate-student"],"pillars":["innovation"],"image":"","excerpt":"UW political scientist <a href=\"http:\/\/www.polisci.washington.edu\/Directory\/Faculty\/Faculty\/faculty_wilkerson.html\">John Wilkerson<\/a> has matched data visualization with the study of lawmaking to create a new online tool for researchers and students called the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.legex.org\/\">Legislative Explorer<\/a>.","content":"(News &amp; Info, April 2014)\n\nUniversity of Washington political scientist <a href=\"http:\/\/www.polisci.washington.edu\/Directory\/Faculty\/Faculty\/faculty_wilkerson.html\">John Wilkerson<\/a> has matched data visualization with the study of lawmaking to create a new online tool for researchers and students called the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.legex.org\/\">Legislative Explorer<\/a>.\n\nThink of it as big data meeting up with How a Bill Becomes a Law.\n\n\u201cThe goal was to get beyond the \u2018Schoolhouse Rock\u2019 narrative and let users discover the lawmaking process for themselves,\u201d said Wilkerson, UW professor of political science and director of the <a href=\"http:\/\/cappp.org\/\">UW\u2019s Center for American Politics and Public Policy<\/a>. The free tool is available at<a href=\"http:\/\/www.legex.org\/\">www.legex.org<\/a>.\n\nThe data set is huge indeed: The Legislative Explorer tracks the progress of every bill and resolution introduced in Congress since 1973 \u2014 250,000 in all. It notes each time a bill or resolution advances from one stage of the process to the next, in or out of committee or moves to the floor for consideration, totaling about 750,000 such movements.\n\nUsers can drill down through the graphically presented data in lots of ways, including by type of legislation, sponsors, party or chamber of origin. The tool also has filters allowing users to sort results many ways, including by gender of sponsoring legislator, committee affiliation and \u2014 perhaps most helpful of all \u2014 whether the legislation is considered major or minor.\n\n\u201cThe basic idea was to apply the data-driven discovery methods used increasingly in the natural sciences to bring big data to the lawmaking process,\u201d Wilkerson said.\n\nWilkerson collaborated with <a href=\"http:\/\/staff.washington.edu\/stramp\/\">Nicholas Stramp<\/a>, a UW doctoral student in political science, who organized the data underlying the online tool. The two also hired <a href=\"https:\/\/www.schemadesign.com\/\">Schema<\/a>, a Seattle-based creative design and technology studio, to create and maintain the site.Wilkerson and collaborators suggest students or researchers might start by observing how many bills are introduced in each Congress and how many die along the way or are sent to the president and become law. They also suggest researchers should keep certain caveats in mind, including the reminder that bills vary in importance and get substantially changed or combined with others. The 906-page Affordable Care Act, Wilkerson noted, started out as a six-page bill on service members\u2019 home ownership.\n\nWilkerson said those using the online tool may find Congress a good deal busier than they expected. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot happening in Congress, but more of it these days is getting stuck at the stage where the House and Senate have to reconcile their differences.\u201d\n\nFuture improvements, Wilkerson said, may include tracking the impact of legislation that becomes law. For example, \u201cWhat happens when Congress passes a law? How does it impact the existing authorities of the federal government and the regulatory activities of federal agencies?\u201d\n\nThe project was funded in part by revenue from <a href=\"http:\/\/info.legsim.org\/\">LegSim<\/a>, which provides tools for legislative simulation courses, and by the National Science Foundation.\n\nWilkerson said the tool seeks to enable citizens to become better informed about the complex legislative process, beyond simplistic descriptions and media coverage centering mostly on Congressional controversies.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t address everything the people might want to know, but we think the Legislative Explorer will advance public interest and understanding of \u2018their\u2019 Legislature,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry,\u201d Wilkerson added. \u201cIt\u2019s not the end of \u2018Schoolhouse Rock.'\u201d\n<p align=\"center\">###<\/p>\nFind the Legislative Explorer online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.legex.org\/\">www.legex.org\/<\/a>.

Recently, Mehlhase and numerous others at\u00a0the <a href=\"http:\/\/home.web.cern.ch\/\">European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN<\/a>, volunteered to sort thousands of pieces into kits for more than 20 models that were then distributed to a variety of institutions around the world, including the one that came to the UW.\n\nBuilding the model presents a great opportunity to broaden public interest in science and to explain, in lay terms, \u201cthe problems we are trying to attack,\u201d said <a href=\"http:\/\/faculty.washington.edu\/schsu\/\">Shih-Chieh Hsu<\/a>, a UW assistant professor of physics who has worked with the students.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about outreach education,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is something that we think can inspire interest for all ages.\u201d\n\nThe UW has strong ties to the Large Hadron Collider, operated by <a href=\"http:\/\/home.web.cern.ch\/\">CERN<\/a> near Geneva, Switzerland. The collider made history in 2012 by providing evidence for an elusive subatomic particle called the Higgs boson \u2013 sometimes referred to as \u201cthe God particle\u201d \u2013 a discovery that provided a major step in understanding the origins of the universe.\n\nUW scientists and engineers played a key role in building the Atlas detector, one of two detectors central to the Higgs discovery. The Atlas detector is half the size of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and weighs in at more than 7,700 tons. The UW group was instrumental in designing and building one of its subsystems, the muon spectrometer.\n\nThe forward muon detector on Atlas contains more than 430 chambers filled with aluminum tubes ranging in length from about 5 feet to 10 feet. About 30,000 of the tubes were made at UW between 2000 and 2007, fitted into 80 chambers and shipped to Geneva. Another 60,000 tubes were made with UW methods and specifications at two other U.S. sites and then shipped to Geneva. The chambers were mounted into 32 sections shaped like giant pie wedges, which fit together into two rings at either end of the main Atlas detector.\n\nUW physicists continue to work on Atlas, helping to outfit the detector with a new component called the Insertable b-Layer to allow even more sensitive measurements of the Higgs boson and other related particles. The Insertable b-Layer is essentially a digital camera that can create pictures of what happens inside the detector immediately after particle collisions, but while a typical camera has one silicon detector the Atlas pixel detector has more than 1,700.\n\nThe dimensions of the UW\u2019s Lego model, built in the Physics-Astronomy Building during May and June, are about one-fiftieth of the real thing. Getting the model just right was an engrossing prospect for the students, Whallon said.\n\n\u201cSurprisingly \u2013 or maybe not so surprisingly \u2013 the Legos proved to be attractive to the graduate students,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Lego model is now displayed on campus in a clear-plastic case and is being featured during the annual U.S. Atlas workshop, which brings together physicists from across the country and this year is being held at the UW.\n\nEventually the model could be taken to other venues, such as the Pacific Science Center in Seattle, and even taken apart so that a whole new group of students can assemble it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good way to get kids interested in high-energy physics, which isn\u2019t so easy to do,\u201d Whallon said.\n\n###\n\n(This story was modified on Aug. 11, 2014, to clarify origins of the Atlas detector model outreach effort.)"},{"title":"Students calculate future sea-level rise in Olympia","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/students-calculate-future-sea-level-rise-in-olympia\/","tags":["arts-sciences","graduate-school","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"One statistician is\u00a0gauging the uncertainties around projections of climate change.

One statistician is focusing on what we <em>can\u2019t<\/em> know \u2013 gauging the uncertainties around projections of climate change.\n\nThat professor helped eight University of Washington students do a detailed study of the rising level of south Puget Sound in Olympia, the state capital, and the uncertainties around those estimates. All are co-authors on a paper to be published in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www2.ametsoc.org\/ams\/index.cfm\/publications\/journals\/journal-of-applied-meteorology-and-climatology\/\">Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology<\/a>.\n\n\u201cAs an educational experience, the class was pretty phenomenal,\u201d said <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stat.washington.edu\/peter\/\">Peter Guttorp<\/a>, a UW professor of statistics. \u201cWe expected it to take three or four weeks, but it took about eight weeks.\u201d\n\nStudents in the spring 2013 Statistical Climatology course did a case study on Olympia shorelines. They used the latest climate models to forecast global ocean temperatures and sea-level rise, then used historical records to relate those changes to sea level in Seattle. Finally they used a more limited set of tide gauge data to relate Seattle and Olympia high-tide marks.\n\nThe group found that by 2100 the water near Olympia will rise by 14 to 32 inches, or slightly more than the open oceans. Seattle water lines will rise by about the same amount, supporting the latest reports from the <a title=\"Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change<\/a>.\n\nThe undergraduate and graduate students \u2013 majoring in statistics, public policy and forestry \u2013 also used methods Guttorp developed to calculate the range around those estimates. Most of the uncertainty, they found, is in the global climate models.Besides publishing a research paper, the students created a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/courses.washington.edu\/statclim\/\">website<\/a> and map to display their findings, as well as describe the scientific reasons for sea-level rise and outline policy options. Their interactive map includes the location of existing underground storage tanks, obtained from a City of Olympia website, which could pose a hazard if the groundwater rises to that level.\n\n\u201cI really liked the collaborative atmosphere,\u201d said student <a href=\"http:\/\/hpodschwit.wordpress.com\/\">Harry Podschwit<\/a>. The class would meet for discussions twice a week and then work to look up information, run calculations or write computer programs. \u201cI learned a lot about policy, and that was important for developing a foundation of a scientific career.\u201d He is now a graduate student in the UW\u2019s interdisciplinary program in <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/qerm\/\">Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management<\/a>.\n\nThe City of Olympia has been planning for sea-level rise since 1990. The city\u2019s low-lying downtown and location at the tip of Puget Sound made it one of the first in the country to look at this issue. Even if the sea was motionless the high-water mark would depend on the topography. But water also sloshes around with weather and the tides, and Budd Inlet, at the very tip of Puget Sound, can already see a tidal range of 22 feet.\n\nThe new research paper includes graphs of the projected sea-level rise in Olympia during this century. The authors also flip the question around, looking at when the sea could reach some key points.\n\n\u201cIt might be useful to know how likely is it to get a certain level by some date?\u201d Guttorp said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get those error bars.\u201d\n\nFor example, the study shows that water is likely to rise 10 inches by around 2050, but there\u2019s a 90 percent chance the water will cross that 10-inch mark sometime between 2029 and 2075.\n\nGuttorp studies how uncertainty changes when moving from global climate models down to the regional models needed to create policy on such things as whether to build retaining walls, when to revise building codes and where to relocate crucial infrastructure.\n\nThe group shared its website with Olympia City Council and hopes the results can support local planning efforts. The paper also addresses broader questions about how to account for uncertainty in projections of sea-level rise.\n\nThe other UW student authors are Alex Januzzi, Marie Novak, Lee Richardson, Colin Sowder and Aaron Zimmerman.

Inventing and puppeteering began as a hobby, but in 2012 a woman in South Africa contacted Owen in hopes that he and a collaborator could fashion something more meaningful: a mechanical hand for her son, Liam, who was born without fingers on his right hand. A friend suggested they cut costs and quicken assembly time by printing the parts, and soon Liam became the first recipient of a 3-D printed hand. Fast-forward to 2015, and more than 1,500 similar assistive devices have been delivered across the globe.\n\nWith 3-D printing, Owen found the perfect medium for creating assistive devices for children. \u201cNot only does it make it easier to produce components quickly and less expensively, but we can rescale the design as the child grows,\u201d explains Owen. Encouraged by the impact of the hand on Liam, Owen decided that the best way to maximize the accessibility of the device was to release the design under a public domain license \u2014 meaning it can be freely downloaded or improved upon by anyone. Today, anyone can access printable hand designs through <a href=\"http:\/\/enablingthefuture.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">e-NABLE<\/a>, a website connecting children to assistive devices, volunteers with access to 3-D printers and a community of support. The site also fuels innovation: Many of the designs are improvements to the original hand made by a global network of designers, including Owen.\n\nIn addition to serving as a board member for e-NABLE, Owen is teaching the next generation of outside-the-box thinkers as a lab manager at UW Bothell\u2019s Makerspace lab. Since opening in early 2015, the lab has grown to more than 30 undergraduate students working on projects ranging from improving upon the e-NABLE community\u2019s hand designs to creating a more accessible 3-D printer. Additionally, the lab provides a unique interdisciplinary experience. One project \u2014 a motorized, low-cost hand that provides a sense of touch \u2014 brought together students from mechanical and electrical engineering, biology, computer science, mathematics and law. Owen hopes that they will soon be able to fit children with devices at the lab, letting the students see for themselves how their work can do a world of good.\n\nThrough guidance from both Owen and his mentor Pierre Mourad, a professor of engineering and math at UW Bothell and neurological surgery at the UW School of Medicine, the lab is a place of truly boundless possibility. \u201cThere are no limits,\u201d says Robby Shaffer, a junior studying mechanical engineering. \u201cYou can go anywhere as long as you\u2019re willing to put in the work, and Pierre and Ivan will support you to do that.\u201d\n\nOwen still enjoys creating props and volunteering with e-NABLE, but he\u2019s found his true passion is working with students in the Makerspace lab. \u201cEducation is its own art form, really. I get to come into work every day and engage in one kind of art, and then I go home and do another.\u201d\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>Sparking student innovation<\/h2>\nInspired by Owen\u2019s 3-D printed hand design and the e-NABLE community, students from the UW, UW Bothell and Seattle Pacific University initiated and organized Seattle\u2019s first ever \u201cHandathon\u201d in February 2015. The event drew students, faculty, engineers and other like-minded innovators to the UW\u2019s Mechanical Engineering Building for 24 hours of creative collaboration.

His plan to get one involved two accomplices, an unsuspecting victim, and rolls of duct tape to bind and gag the victim in his own car trunk. After the ill-conceived plan unraveled and the victim managed to escape, Coats was sentenced to 20 years in prison for robbery, kidnapping, and attempted murder.\n\nHe was 14 years old.\n\nCoats served 17 years at the Washington State Reformatory (WSR) in Monroe. Since his release, he has become a successful real estate agent in Seattle. His story is the subject of a thought-provoking radio documentary produced by UW Professor Katherine Beckett and a team of UW students and alumni, in partnership with radio journalists from the University of British Columbia (UBC). The 40-minute documentary, which aired on UBC\u2019s Cited podcast and UW\u2019s KUOW Radio, is now available <a href=\"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/citedpodcast\/cited-1-superpredators-revisited\">online<\/a>.\n\nBeckett came up with the idea for the documentary after attending a meeting of the Concerned Lifers Organization (CLO), a group of inmates at WSR interested in prison reform. The men commented that the media tends to report on inmates who get out, mess up, and return to prison. \u201cThey asked, \u2018Why aren\u2019t the success stories being told?\u2019\u201d recalls Beckett, professor of sociology and law, societies, and justice. \u201cIt\u2019s a heartfelt issue for them because it reinforces the idea that people can\u2019t change. And they know that people can and do change and mature.\u201d\n\nBeckett decided to tell some of those success stories herself. She enlisted the help of UW students with an interest in prison reform, all of whom had recently taken a Law, Societies and Justice (LSJ) course held at WSR, with inmates as their classmates. \u201cThe class had just ended and a lot of the students were really motivated to keep working on something related,\u201d says Beckett.\n\nCLO members provided the UW team with the names of nearly two dozen former inmates they had stayed in touch with, now leading successful lives on the outside. So far the team has interviewed three of the men. \u201cAll of them have been totally on board with the concept,\u201d says Beckett. \u201cThey made a commitment in their lives to be honest and open about their past, so getting them to talk was not a problem at all.\u201d\n\nBryce Ellis, a communication and LSJ major, participated in several of the interviews. He was deeply affected by the men\u2019s stories. \u201cHaving the chance to confront the painful realities of our criminal justice system, the impact this system has on people, and how they work to overcome and change their lives has meant a lot to me and given me a deep belief in humans\u2019 capacity for positive growth and change,\u201d says Ellis.\n<div class=\"fig-fix-wrap right\">Though the interviews were compelling, the prospect of shaping them into broadcast-quality pieces was daunting\u2014until Beckett mentioned the project to radio journalists Sam Fenn and Gordon Katic from UBC, who were intrigued and offered to help. \u201cThey had connections and equipment and they\u2019re really good at what they do,\u201d says Beckett. \u201cIt was a great collaboration.\u201d<\/div>\nFenn and Katic, determined to present both sides of the story, contacted the victim of Jeff Coats\u2019s bungled crime, Tacoma businessman David Grenier. Grenier was initially resistant to being interviewed for the radio documentary but was curious about Coats. The team became a conduit between the two men, enabling them to address questions they had had for years. Eventually Grenier agreed to an interview. \u201cIt was very emotional for him,\u201d says Beckett. \u201cHe was very impacted by what happened, and his family was too, and we felt it was important to not gloss over that.\u201d\n\nThe resulting documentary tells the riveting story of the crime and its aftermath from the perspective of both Coats and Grenier. It also shares Coats\u2019s devastating backstory, including severe abuse by his stepfather that led to his placement in foster care at age 11. Because many foster care placements are intended as short-term solutions, Coats was shuffled to 62 foster homes in three years.\n\nCoats\u2019s story raises important questions about the sentencing of juveniles as adults\u2014a common practice in the United States but not other countries\u2014and the potential for inmates to turn their lives around. In prison, Coats was in frequent fights with other inmates until he made a conscious decision to change. He became a voracious reader of books about real estate, which led to a job after his release. His employer, also featured in the podcast, recalls being impressed during the job interview by Coats\u2019s passion for real estate and his stunning honesty about his criminal past.\n\n\u201cJeff\u2019s story is inspiring,\u201d says Beckett. \u201cHe turned it around. His may not seem like a typical story, but I\u2019ve met people like him all over the place, and they all have stories like this.\u201d\n\nBeckett hopes to tell more of those stories in the future. She believes they would make a compelling radio series\u2014if she can find the necessary funding.\n\n\u201cI really want to keep doing this,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it\u2019s important. We have this aging population of people in prison who are not a threat to public safety, many of whom have done some amazing work to really turn their lives around. They never have an opportunity to tell that story of change.

Listed among the medications was Benadryl, a common over-the-counter antihistamine. Initially skeptical of the findings, but intrigued by the ramifications, Gray and her research team joined a UW\u2013Group Health study tracking nearly 3,500 adults over the age of 65. Armed with a plethora of pharmacy data, they examined the participants\u2019 medication use over time.\n\nAfter following participants for an average of seven years, the team was concerned by the results: a persistent link between long-term use of anticholinergic medications and developing dementia. \u201cWe were a bit nervous to report our findings because these medications are common, and some are available over-the-counter,\u201d she says. After the team published their findings this past January, the results struck a chord with people around the globe. But beyond igniting the interest of countless national and international media outlets, the study affected Gray on a personal level.\n\n\u201cI feel a big responsibility reading the many emails from actual people who are concerned about their years of medication use. I experienced on a personal level how study results can effect people\u2019s lives.\u201d (Gray emphasizes that people should take any medication concerns to their prescriber, and together they can determine the best treatment option.) She could also relate to their concerns firsthand; as someone with insomnia, she has taken Benadryl as a sleep aid. Overall, Gray is optimistic: She sees the study as an important step toward the larger goal of improving older adults\u2019 quality of life. \u201cWe\u2019ve known for a long time that these medications cause acute side effects,\u201d she explains. \u201cHopefully, this additional risk might make people stop and think.\u201d\n\nGray\u2019s expertise and passion for geriatric pharmacy are already inspiring the next generation of pharmacists. As director of the UW\u2019s Geriatric Pharmacy Program, she hopes students will continue to understand the importance of studying geriatric pharmacy. \u201cNo matter what setting students find themselves in eventually, they\u2019re going to have interactions with older adults.\u201d\n\nUnder Gray\u2019s guidance, the program has seen exponential growth, with about a fifth of each class now graduating with a Plein Certificate in Geriatric Pharmacy. With the program flourishing and her research evolving from idea to impact, Gray looks forward to the UW\u2019s continued leadership in the field. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see that your work is actually helping patients and providers make safer medication choices.\u201d\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/sop.washington.edu\/higher-dementia-risk-linked-use-common-drugs\/\">Learn more<\/a> about the study from the School of Pharmacy.\n<h2>Explore the UW<\/h2>\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/sop.washington.edu\/department-of-pharmacy\/geriatric-pharmacy-program\/\">Geriatric Pharmacy Program<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/sop.washington.edu\/\">School of Pharmacy<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/hsnewsbeat.uw.edu\/story\/higher-dementia-risk-linked-more-use-common-drugs\">Health Sciences<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>In the news<\/h2>\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/video\/study-over-the-counter-drugs-linked-to-dementia\/201CF1B1-D02C-41FB-959F-AC4CC549E7DF.html\">Wall Street Journal<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.livescience.com\/49581-anticholinergic-drugs-dementia-risk.html\">Live Science<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/health-30988643\">BBC<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2015\/jan\/27\/sleeping-drugs-increased-risk-alzheimers\">The Guardian<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/daviddisalvo\/2015\/01\/29\/study-popular-over-the-counter-drugs-may-increase-dementia-risk\/\">Forbes<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2015\/04\/07\/sleep-aids-mental-illness-link_n_7000844.html\">Huffington Post<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>"},{"title":"Climate clues","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/climate-clues\/","tags":["college-of-the-environment","faculty","global","graduate-student"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"By investigating ancient Antarctic ice, researchers from the College of the Environment are unlocking climate clues from the earth\u2019s deepest reaches.","content":"(News &amp; Info, May 2015)\n<h1 class=\"entry-title\">Antarctic ice core shows northern trigger for ice age climate shifts<\/h1>\n<div class=\"author-info\"><\/div>\nEvidence trapped in ice cores from the West Antarctica Ice Sheet show a consistent link between abrupt temperature changes in Greenland and Antarctica during the most recent ice age.

The UW group used analyses of the oxygen in the water molecules in the ice to obtain the most precise record of Antarctica\u2019s temperature history to compare temperature swings at the two poles. <a href=\"http:\/\/earthweb.ess.washington.edu\/~steig\/\">Eric Steig<\/a>, a UW professor of Earth and space sciences, co-led the research paper with corresponding author <a href=\"http:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/C_Buizert\">Christo Buizert<\/a>, a postdoctoral researcher at Oregon State University, and <a href=\"http:\/\/jisao.washington.edu\/press\/staffspotlights\/pedro\">Joel Pedro<\/a>, a former UW postdoctoral researcher now at the University of Copenhagen.\n\nIce cores analyzed in the 1990s at the UW and elsewhere confirmed that Greenland\u2019s climate during the last ice age was very unstable, characterized by a number of large, abrupt changes in temperature. These so-called <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dansgaard%E2%80%93Oeschger_event\">Dansgaard-Oeschger events<\/a> took place every few thousand years, raising mean annual temperatures in Greenland and surrounding areas by about 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit) over just a few decades.\n\nMeanwhile, temperatures in Antarctica showed an opposite pattern, with Antarctica cooling by a smaller amount at roughly the same time Greenland was warming. This suggests some type of global seesaw.\n\nIn the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nature\/journal\/v520\/n7549\/full\/nature14401.html\">new paper<\/a>, researchers find that the changes first appear in Greenland, and a response in Antarctica follows about 200 years later.\n\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em\">\u201cPast ice core studies did not reveal the temperature changes as clearly as this remarkable core,\u201d Steig said.\u00a0<\/span>Key to the result is the analysis of a new ice core from West Antarctica, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/news\/2011\/02\/02\/two-mile-antarctic-ice-core-could-shed-light-on-climate-change\/\">drilled for five years ending in 2011<\/a> by the University of Wisconsin\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.icedrill.org\/about\/iddo.shtml\">Ice Drilling and Design Operations<\/a> and funded by the National Science Foundation. The core extends down 3.4 kilometers, or more than 2 miles.\n\nMeasurements of the core\u2019s ice in the UW\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/isolab.ess.washington.edu\/isolab\/\">IsoLab<\/a>, which Steig leads, documented a series of 18 temperature swings in Antarctica, each one corresponding with the abrupt Dansgaard-Oeschger events known from Greenland ice cores for the past 68,000 years. The technique uses the ratio of different forms of oxygen atoms in the ice core\u2019s layers to deduce the air temperature when the snow was deposited.\n\nThe region where the core was drilled gets abundant snow, and so provides one of the most detailed records of Antarctic temperature. Greenland temperatures were already well established because of high annual snowfall and more available ice-core data.\n\nThe new work solves a classic chicken-and-egg problem in Earth\u2019s climate history.\n\n\u201cPrevious work was not precise enough to determine the relative timing of abrupt climate change in Antarctica and Greenland, and so it was unclear which happened first,\u201d Steig said.\n\n\u201cOur new results show unambiguously that the Antarctic changes happen after the rapid temperature changes in Greenland,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a major advance to know that the Earth behaves in this particular way.\u201d\nThe opposing changes at the two poles suggested that something is redistributing heat between the northern and southern hemispheres.The study was funded by the National Science Foundation and included almost 80 authors.\n\n\u201cThe 200-year lag that we observe certainly hints at an oceanic mechanism,\u201d Buizert said. \u201cThe ocean is large and sluggish, thus the 200-year time lag is a pretty clear fingerprint of the ocean\u2019s involvement.\u201d\n\nThese past episodes of climate change differ from the changes now caused by carbon dioxide emissions, and probably could not happen today, Steig added, because they are related to the large ice sheets that once covered Canada and northern Europe.\n\nBuizert said it is \u201cvery likely\u201d that a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eoearth.org\/view\/article\/150290\/\">major current<\/a> in the Atlantic Ocean was involved in the abrupt climate reversals.The area off the coast of Greenland is where warmer water from the tropics cools and sinks to the bottom of the ocean, and is a \u201csweet spot,\u201d he said, where the climate is very sensitive to changes in ocean circulation.\n\nIt so happens that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geosociety.org\/awards\/05speeches\/penrose.htm\">Minze Stuiver<\/a>, a UW professor emeritus of Earth and space sciences, made the same type of oxygen isotope measurements for the Greenland ice cores. That work in the early 1990s was critical in first demonstrating the speed of the Dansgaard-Oeschger climate changes, Steig said, and it is fitting that the new measurements were also made at the UW.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come full circle in building on the seminal work that my graduate adviser conducted more than twenty years ago,\u201d Steig said.\n\nOther co-authors at the UW are graduate student <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ess.washington.edu\/dwp\/people\/profileG.php?name=markle--bradley\">Bradley Markle<\/a>; postdoctoral researchers\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Spruce_Schoenemann\/publications\">Spruce Schoenemann<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Mai_Winstrup\">Mai Winstrup<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ess.washington.edu\/dwp\/people\/profileG.php?name=fudge--tj\">T.J.

Though the city is home to many of Mexico\u2019s wealthy citizens and boasts an abundance of cultural and historic sites, its roads are riddled with potholes. As a senior in high school, Ojeda noticed that there was no database that showed where the potholes were \u2014 effectively creating a barrier between the government and its citizens. \u201cPeople were not reporting problems, and the government was not fixing them,\u201d he says. So, along with some of his friends, he decided to do something about it.\n\nBut Ojeda, a freshman computer science major, knows that success often requires courageous choices \u2014 like leaving Cuernavaca for Seattle, more than 2,000 miles north of his hometown. It was the pull of a city with an abundance of tech opportunities and a university with a highly ranked Computer Science &amp; Engineering program that initially brought him here. Then he discovered, and was accepted to, the Leonard and Bernice Lavin Entrepreneurial Action Program, formed in partnership with the Foster School of Business and the Buerk Center for Entrepreneurship.They created Xop\u00e1n, a mobile app that allowed citizens to report infrastructure problems to the government. \u201cWe gave open government a chance in a place where transparency was nil,\u201d he says. Although the app worked well and was gaining popularity, Ojeda and his friends had to leave the project behind when they scattered far and wide for college.\n\nThanks to the financial support of the highly competitive program, students like Ojeda visit venture-capitalist firms and startups, attend mentor meetings and workshops, receive scholarships to intern in early-stage companies and more. But first and foremost, they\u2019re immersed in the culture of creating their own opportunities. Many older students in the program often get internships through informal, self-initiated networking. \u201cIt\u2019s basically in their DNA,\u201d Ojeda says.\n\nAlthough he\u2019s been at the UW for less than a year, Ojeda\u2019s already befriended fellow students who aspire to launch their own businesses, met with startup founders over coffee and talked to venture-capitalist investors about learning from failure. Through a host of Lavin Entrepreneurship Program\u2013sponsored events, he\u2019s collected a stack of business cards and handed off his resume to several young companies in town. With luck, he\u2019ll secure an internship this summer in Seattle \u2014 perhaps even at Startup Hall, an on-campus business incubator formed as the result of an innovative public-private partnership at the UW.\n\nThough he doesn\u2019t know what, specifically, he wants to do in the long run, he knows that it\u2019s bigger than just making money. At the heart of it all is empowerment and accessibility. \u201cJust growing up in Mexico, traveling around, made me think differently,\u201d says Ojeda. His grandfather lived in Acatl\u00e1n, a small indigenous community in Guerrerro, one of Mexico\u2019s poorest states, and Ojeda visited him many times.\n\n\u201cGetting to know these poor communities, it starts to grow in your mind: \u2018How can I help?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cSo when you\u2019re developing something, it\u2019s not just for the wealthy. Technology is the easiest way to impact a lot of people. And that\u2019s what inspires me every day, to try to work better and work harder.\u201d\n<h3>Lasting legacy, boundless opportunities<\/h3>\nWhen you create an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/giving\/how-to-give\/more-ways-to-give\/endowments\/\">endowment at the University of Washington<\/a>, you bolster the work of students, programs and faculty for generations to come.

Of those soldiers who might potentially survive, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23192066\">most die from uncontrolled bleeding<\/a>.\n\nIn some cases, there\u2019s not much medics can do \u2014 a tourniquet won\u2019t stop bleeding from a chest wound, and clotting treatments that require refrigerated or frozen blood products aren\u2019t always available in the field.\n\nThat\u2019s why University of Washington researchers have developed a new injectable polymer that strengthens blood clots, called PolySTAT. Administered in a simple shot, the polymer finds any unseen or internal injuries and starts working immediately.\n\nThe new polymer, described <a href=\"http:\/\/stm.sciencemag.org\/content\/7\/277\/277ra29.full.pdf\">in a paper<\/a> featured on the cover of the March 4 issue of <a href=\"http:\/\/stm.sciencemag.org\/\">Science Translational Medicine,<\/a> could become a first line of defense in everything from battlefield injuries to rural car accidents to search and rescue missions deep in the mountains. It has been tested in rats, and researchers say it could reach human trials in five years.\n\nIn the initial study with rats, 100 percent of animals injected with PolySTAT survived a typically-lethal injury to the femoral artery. Only 20 percent of rats treated with a natural protein that helps blood clot survived.\n\n\u201cThis is something you could potentially put in a syringe inside a backpack and give right away to reduce blood loss and keep people alive long enough to make it to medical care,\u201d he said.\u201cMost of the patients who die from bleeding die quickly,\u201d said co-author\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/doemuw\/home\/faculty\/white-nathan\">Dr. Nathan White<\/a>, an assistant professor of <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/doemuw\/\">emergency medicine<\/a> who teamed with UW <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/bioe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bioengineers<\/a> and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cheme.washington.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">chemical engineers<\/a> to develop the macromolecule.\n\nThe UW team was inspired by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webmd.com\/children\/factor-xiii-deficiency\">factor XIII<\/a>, a natural protein found in the body that helps strengthen blood clots.\n\nNormally after an injury, platelets in the blood begin to congregate at the wound and form an initial barrier. Then a network of specialized fibers \u2014 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.britannica.com\/EBchecked\/topic\/205873\/fibrin\">called fibrin<\/a> \u2014 start weaving themselves throughout the clot to reinforce it.\n\nIf that scaffolding can\u2019t withstand the pressure of blood pushing against it, the clot breaks apart and the patient keeps bleeding.\n\nBoth PolySTAT and factor XIII strengthen clots by binding fibrin strands together and adding \u201ccross-links\u201d that reinforce the latticework of that natural bandage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the difference between twisting two ropes together and weaving a net,\u201d said co-author <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/bioe\/portfolio-items\/pun\/\">Suzie Pun<\/a>, the UW\u2019s Robert J. Rushmer Professor of Bioengineering. \u201cThe cross-linked net is much stronger.\u201d\n\nBut the synthetic PolySTAT offers greater protection against natural enzymes that dissolve blood clots. Those help during the healing process, but they work against doctors trying to keep patients from bleeding to death.\n\nThe enzymes, which cut fibrin strands, don\u2019t target the synthetic PolySTAT bonds that are now integrated into the clot. That helps keep the blood clots intact in the critical hours after an injury.\n\n\u201cWe were really testing how robust the clots were that formed,\u201d said lead author <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/lesliewchan\">Leslie Chan<\/a>, a UW doctoral student in bioengineering. \u201cThe animals injected with PolySTAT bled much less, and 100 percent of them lived.\u201d\n\nBlood products are expensive, need careful storage, and they can grow bacteria or carry infectious diseases, he said. Plus, the hundreds of proteins introduced into a patient\u2019s body during a transfusion can have unintended consequences.The synthetic polymer offers other advantages over conventional hemorrhaging treatments, said White, who also treats trauma patients at Harborview Medical Center.\n\nAfter a traumatic injury, the body also begins to lose a protein that\u2019s critical to forming fibrin. Once those levels drop below a certain threshold, existing treatments stop working and patients are more likely to die.\n\nIn the study, researchers found PolySTAT worked to strengthen clots even in cases where those fibrin building blocks were critically low.\n\nThe UW team also used a highly specific peptide that only binds to fibrin at the wound site. It does not bind to a precursor of fibrin that circulates throughout the body. That means PolySTAT shouldn\u2019t form dangerous clots that can lead to a stroke or embolism.\n\nThough the polymer\u2019s initial safety profile looks promising, researchers said, next steps include testing on larger animals and additional screening to find out if it binds to any other unintended substances. They also plan to investigate its potential for treating hemophilia and for integration into bandages.\n\nOther co-authors are Xu Wang in UW emergency medicine, Hua Wei in UW bioengineering, and <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/pozzorg\/\">Lilo Pozzo<\/a> in UW chemical engineering.\n\nFunding came from the National Institutes of Health and its National Center for Advancing Translational Science, the UW <a href=\"https:\/\/www.iths.org\/\">Institute of Translational Health Sciences<\/a>, the Washington Research Foundation, an NIH-supported UW Bioengineering Cardiovascular Training Grant and discretionary funds from private donations.\n\nFor more information, contact Pun at <a href=\"mailto:spun@uw.edu\">spun@uw.edu<\/a> or White at <a href=\"mailto:whiten4@uw.edu\">whiten4@uw.edu<\/a>."},{"title":"Saving lives with smartphones","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/saving-lives-with-smartphones\/","tags":["engineering","global","school-of-medicine","public-health","undergraduate-student","medicine"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Saloni Parikh took her passion for global health and her knack for computer science engineering halfway across the world, playing a key role in HIV-fighting research.","content":"(Homepage, April 2015)\n\nA poverty-stricken city on the murky shore of Lake Victoria, Kisumu is the third-largest city in Kenya.

While these measurements are fairly straightforward, the information they relay about Earth\u2019s health is much more complex.\n\nAs the planet warms, much of the heat is absorbed in the oceans, resulting in rising sea levels and changes to how water mixes and currents move. While 85 percent of the temperature in the upper water column is well studied, scientists have uncovered \u201cless than 5 percent of what\u2019s between 2,000 meters and the bottom,\u201d says <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ocean.washington.edu\/home\/Fritz+Stahr\">Fritz Stahr<\/a>, manager of the <a href=\"http:\/\/seaglider.washington.edu\/\">UW\u2019s Seaglider Fabrication Center<\/a>. \u201cThe deep ocean may play a large role in how much heat is absorbed from the atmosphere and spread around the oceans.\u201d Now, the center\u2019s team stands to vastly improve that number with the Deepglider autonomous underwater vehicle.\n\nIn 1995, <a href=\"http:\/\/coenv.washington.edu\/faculty\/charles-eriksen\/\">Charles Eriksen<\/a>, a UW professor of oceanography, knew that the status quo prevented researchers from truly studying the changing oceans. Repeatedly surveying the open ocean using research vessels is unaffordable more than one or twice every decade, and much ocean variability takes place in between those trips.\n\nMotivated by a passion for cracking the code behind the sea\u2019s variability, Eriksen began working on a solution to this difficult process. The initial result was Seaglider, a vehicle that can repeatedly dive up to 1,000 meters below the surface for about a year. The next step was to go deeper. Eriksen and his small group of engineers developed the next generation of autonomous explorer: Deepglider.\n\nDeepgliders can repeatedly dive 6,000 meters to the seafloor, a feat unmatched by other gliders. While similar to Seaglider, Deepglider\u2019s revised design cut down on drag and employed a novel means of controlling its compression, extending its battery life and enabling the gliders to remain at sea for an unprecedented 18 months. Perhaps most impressively, operating a Deeplider for about a year costs as much as only one day of ship time, meaning more bright minds can undertake deep ocean research.\n\nThe team launched a Deepglider off the coast of Bermuda in January 2015, and it\u2019s still on track to complete its 18-month voyage, revolutionizing underwater research. \u201cThis is a really exciting place to be in the oceanographic field,\u201d adds Stahr. \u201cWe\u2019re at the beginning of opening a whole part of the ocean that has been hidden.\u201d\n<h2>Seaglider Fabrication Center<\/h2>\n<ul>\n\t<li>In addition to building gliders, the staff provides operator training and equipment refurbishment to University units who use them.<\/li>\n\t<li>The center\u2019s collegiate location also creates a unique learning opportunity for students interested in the field.

International partners include Imperial College London, the Royal Veterinary College, University of Bristol, University of Sussex and Oxford University, all in the U.K., and Lund University in Sweden.\n\nThe center will focus on three main research areas:\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Locating objects<\/strong>: Researchers will look at how animals are able to find prey, mates or food sources by encoding and processing information through their senses.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Navigating in complex environments<\/strong>: Insects and bats often fly in windy and crowded spaces, skillfully avoiding collisions. Scientists will study how their neurological and physiological systems function to allow them to move in these ways.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Navigating in sensory-deprived environments<\/strong>: Animals often fly in low light or nearly complete darkness, and in places where their ability to smell and hear might be compromised. Researchers will look more broadly at how animals use sensory information and how they make decisions about flight under different contexts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nLearning from the behavior of insects and animals could inspire more advanced <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Micro_air_vehicle\">micro-air vehicles<\/a>, or small, flying robots. These could be used in difficult search-and-rescue missions, or to help detect explosives or mines when it would be too dangerous for humans to go on foot or in vehicles.\n\n\u201cSmall autonomous unmanned vehicles have the ability to move into spaces and search for injured people or assess structural health in situations where human emergency responders simply cannot access in a safe way, such as in the Oso, Washington, mudslide or the Fukushima plant after the 2011 tsunami in Japan,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aa.washington.edu\/faculty\/morgansen\/\">Kristi Morgansen<\/a>, a UW associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics and one of the center\u2019s faculty leads.\n\nResearchers at the UW will work in the center\u2019s core lab in Kincaid Hall. A large animal wind tunnel to test how animals fly and process sensory information is already in place there, and the team hopes to build an additional motion-capture system to study animal flight and even<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Quadcopter\">quadrotors<\/a>, small helicopters that could become \u201csmarter\u201d flyers by using the sensing abilities of animals.\n\nAside from these applications, center researchers will also develop micro-air vehicles for environmental monitoring. A micro-scaled quadrotor could, for example, navigate through a thick forest to the tree canopy and measure temperature, moisture and gases at different levels in the atmosphere. Or, small unmanned aircraft could be used to track ocean mammals such as whales for more consistent monitoring.\n\nAnother <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/news\/2015\/03\/18\/new-research-suggests-insect-wings-might-serve-gyroscopic-function\/\">specific project <\/a>looks at how insect wings actually serve as both a way to fly and offer real-time measurement of where the insect is moving in space.\n\nFunding for the new center, which comes from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wpafb.af.mil\/afrl\/afosr\/\">Air Force Office of Scientific Research<\/a>, is up to $9 million spread over six years, provided the center passes a renewal every two years. The Department of Biology, the Department of Applied Mathematics, the College of Arts &amp; Sciences, the College of Engineering and the Office of the Provost also are providing money for the center.\n\nAt the UW, researchers ranging from high school students and undergraduates to graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and faculty members will work in the new center.

Earlier this year <a href=\"http:\/\/fish.washington.edu\/people\/parrish\/\">Julia Parrish<\/a>, associate dean for academic affairs and diversity in the <a href=\"http:\/\/coenv.washington.edu\/\">College of the Environment, <\/a>co-authored a <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/coasst\/news\/publications\/Science%20Policy%20Forum.pdf\">policy forum piece<\/a> on citizen science in the journal Science and in August there were <a href=\"http:\/\/eco.confex.com\/eco\/2014\/webprogram\/Paper48280.html\">talks<\/a> at the Ecological Society of America\u2019s annual meeting in the session \u201cCitizen Science from Sea to Sky: Investigating Ecological Responses to Global Environmental Change.\u201d\n\nHere at the UW, citizen science interests faculty members wanting to harness the power of many eyes and hands and to broaden the impact of their work. UW graduate students initiate citizen science efforts and undergraduates work both as volunteers and coordinators of volunteers.\n<p class=\"size-half wp-image-33980\">\u201cWe\u2019re at a tipping point,\u201d Parrish said. \u201cOur need to know and be able to document environmental issues is growing far beyond the reach of academic science and resource management to keep pace<em>.<\/em>\u201c<\/p>\nDespite the need for information, the practice of citizen science \u201cis not universally accepted as a valid method of scientific investigation,\u201d Parrish and co-authors wrote in \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/343\/6178\/1436.short\">Next steps for citizen science<\/a>,\u201d in Science. \u201cScientific papers presenting volunteer-collected data sometimes have trouble getting reviewed and are often placed in outreach sections of journals or education tracks of scientific meetings,\u201d they wrote.\n\nAt the UW, the natural sciences is just one area in which citizen scientists have gathered information that has become the basis of published research and resources reports used by managers, legislators and fellow scientists.\n\nSome examples:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Data gathered by beach walkers who tally dead seabirds that wash ashore as part of the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/coasst\/\">Coastal Observation and Seabird Survey Team<\/a>\u00a0program, known as COASST, have been published in journals such as Marine Ornithology, Marine Pollution Bulletin and Journal of Archaeological Science.<\/li>\n\t<li>Annual five-day collecting trips, where volunteers gather as many as 1,000 specimens, enrich the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.burkemuseum.org\/herbarium\">UW Herbarium<\/a> and contribute to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pnwherbaria.org\/\">online reference<\/a> of choice for regional land managers and professional botanists around the world interested in Pacific Northwest plants.

To ensure that critiques of citizen science efforts are based on merits of research, rather than unfounded assumptions about the practice, the co-authors wrote that developers must employ sound research or monitoring design, and reviewers should look for evidence of such practices.\n\nParrish didn\u2019t have publications particularly in mind when she spearheaded the Coastal Observation and Seabird Survey Team program 16 years ago. A professor of <a href=\"http:\/\/fish.washington.edu\/index.html\">aquatic and fishery sciences<\/a>, she was after an even higher standard: data that could stand up in court if need be. Baselines of how many birds die naturally would be needed in the event of major oil spills or other human-caused events that might wind up in court.\n\nFor faculty and graduate students interested in tapping into citizen science, Parrish said she\u2019d like there to be easier ways to take advantage of existing programs.\n\n\u201cImagine all the people doing terrestrial climate work, plant work, plant science, agronomy \u2013 are they each going to each create a citizen-science program and train people to identify plants?\u201d she asked. \u201cOne way is to create a kind of plug-and-play kind of situation. If at the end of the day, they\u2019re all interested in phenology \u2013 when things in the natural world reoccur \u2013 couldn\u2019t we create a single program that everyone could use?\u201d\n\nThe UW should capitalize on its expertise in natural sciences, education and information technology to become a center for citizen science on the West Coast, Parrish said.\n\n\u201cI would love to see the UW leap into the lead on the West Coast on that,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re knee-deep in environmental scientists. We also have a wonderful College of Education and a great education program at Bothell. We can learn why people join things and what they get out of it, because you want those volunteer data collectors to stay with you until they get good. The last thing you want is for them to breeze in and breeze out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe UW has a kick-butt computer science program, Information School and digital arts and graphic design programs,\u201d Parrish said.\n\nFor example Jeff Heer, an associate professor of computer science and engineering, just received a Gordon and Betty Moore Investigator Award and he\u2019s committed, among other things, to connect his visualization lab to \u201cbig data\u201d produced by citizen science, and especially visualizations targeting non-scientists.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re collecting broad-scale information \u2013 big space, long time \u2013 we need different tools to bring these data together, to check them out, to visualize them \u2013 like a map or a movie \u2013 that can go out to people in near real time, not three years later in a publication.

His deep love of nature eventually led him to the Puget Sound, where he is working on innovations to reduce the underwater noise pollution.\n\nTim is part of a research team working to design a pile that makes marine construction projects quieter. When piles \u2014 the steel tubes that support ferry terminals, bridges and docks \u2014 are driven into the ocean floor, it causes noise that can damage the hearing of many marine mammals and fish, hindering their ability to find food. The impact of pile installation noise to the Puget Sound\u2019s ecosystem is so severe that strict regulations govern marine construction projects, making them more expensive and challenging to complete.\n\nTim and his Ph.D. adviser, Professor and Chair of Mechanical Engineering Per Reinhall, have created a double pile design that confines the installation noise within the pile itself. Their innovation shows such promise that it received initial test-stage funding from the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). Later, the team secured a UW Commercialization Gap Fund to bring their research to the real world.\n\n\u201cGetting the gap funding was a great vote of confidence,\u201d says Tim. \u201cIt has been amazing to have the funds to buy materials and equipment and to consult with experts so we can bring this project to reality.\u201d\n\nToday, WSDOT remains interested in Tim and Per\u2019s invention. The agency is among multiple organizations supporting large-scale tests of the piles in Tacoma\u2019s Commencement Bay this year. Ultimately, the double piles could be adopted worldwide to make construction in marine environments safer for animals and therefore less restrictive and expensive for builders. To prepare for that possibility, the UW Center for Commercialization recently helped Tim, Per and two other colleagues create a startup, Marine Construction Technologies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare for a project to benefit the environment while also reducing the cost of building civil structures,\u201d says Tim. \u201cIt is really exciting to think this work could help ecosystems around the world.\u201d\n<h2>Web extra:<\/h2>\n<h3>One idea, boundless benefits<\/h3>\nEvery day throughout Washington state, businesses and government agencies partner with the UW in efforts to make our region a better place. The work of graduate student Tim Dardis and Professor of Mechanical Engineering Per Reinhall serves as a model of the kind of impact one great UW idea can have on area industries.\n\nThe seed for Tim and Per\u2019s innovation was planted in 2008 when the\u00a0Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) called for proposals for quieter pile designs. Per and UW Professor of Mechanical Engineering Peter Dahl submitted the winning proposal. WSDOT has been supporting the research ever since.\n\nAs Tim and Per fine-tuned the original design to create the double pile concept, multiple other agencies got on board. Organizations like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have contributed resources to this effort. Multiple consulting firms have provided expertise to Per and Tim. Further, two local manufacturers built the piles for the tests in Commencement Bay.\n\nNow the new UW startup and public benefit corporation, Marine Construction Technologies, is fielding inquiries from statewide and national agencies interested in the pile design. The company\u2019s goal is to make its product available to projects near and far. This will mean an increased demand for equipment, manufacturing services, agency partnerships and more.\n\nAs the UW group seeks to reduce the ripple effects of underwater construction noise, their work is poised to make some serious waves in our region\u2019s economy.\n<h3>Collaborating for the future<\/h3>\nAgencies and businesses that have contributed to the double pile research development:\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bittner-shen.com\/\">Bittner-Shen Consulting Engineers Inc.<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.geoengineers.com\/\">GeoEngineers<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.grlengineers.com\/\">GRL Engineers Inc.<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hartcrowser.com\/\">Hart Crowser<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.machinistsinc.com\/\">Machinists Inc.<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.noaa.gov\/\">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.orionmarinegroup.com\/\">Orion Marine Group Inc.<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/portoftacoma.com\/\">Port of Tacoma<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shannonwilson.com\/\">Shannon &amp; Wilson Inc.<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/uwc4c\/\">UW Center for Commercialization<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wrfseattle.org\/\">Washington Research Foundation<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsdot.wa.gov\/\">Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT)<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsdot.wa.gov\/ferries\/\">WSDOT Washington State Ferries<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>"},{"title":"Making waves in marine energy","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/making-waves-in-marine-energy\/","tags":["engineering","comotion","faculty","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"With the ability to gather unprecedented data on the impact of underwater equipment used to harvest wave and tidal energy, the Applied Physics Laboratory's Millennium Falcon robot will help researchers explore the ocean\u2019s future as a renewable energy source.

A fiber optic cable connection back to shore allows for real-time monitoring and control, and the device will be powered by a copper wire.\n\nThe breadth of sensors and various conditions this instrument can measure is unprecedented, researchers say. The tool also is unique for its ability to attach to most types of underwater infrastructure, ranging from tidal turbines to offshore oil and gas rigs. This allows researchers to easily deploy the instrument far offshore and recover it quickly at a relatively low cost compared with other approaches.\n\n\u201cIt could be a first step toward a standardized \u2018science port\u2019 for marine energy projects,\u201d Polagye said.\n<h2>Using the Force<\/h2>\nOne of the researchers behind the Millennium Falcon, Andrew Stewart, is diving deeper into the world of underwater robotics as the ocean engineer at BluHaptics, a 2014 UW startup. BluHaptics makes operating a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) as easy as playing a video game. \u201cControlling an ROV is difficult,\u201d explains Ryan Cox, a senior in electrical engineering and BluHaptics intern. \u201cYou don\u2019t get a sense of depth, so operators bump into things or accidentally break parts off.\u201d\n\nThe startup\u2019s algorithms and software provide haptic \u2014 or force \u2014 feedback on the joystick-like controller. Operators are guided into the perfect grasp and manipulation of an object, and can rotate the image to view the arm\u2019s position in relation to other objects. The technology also creates a 3-D representation of the ROV\u2019s target objects and their environments, which the operator can view on a monitor or through a virtual reality headset. BluHaptics\u2019 technology is largely based on the recent Ph.D. dissertation of Dr. Fredrik Ryd\u00e9n, a research associate in the UW\u2019s electrical engineering department.\n\nBolstered by <a href=\"http:\/\/comotion.uw.edu\/\">CoMotion<\/a>, BluHaptics is exploring broad applications of the software in underwater tasks, from repairing equipment to cleaning up oil spills. The company was also named to the Puget Sound Business Journal\u2019s 2014 list of five UW \u201cstartups to watch.\u201d Dr. Howard Chizeck, BluHaptics\u2019 chairman of the board and UW professor of electrical engineering, says he is looking forward to the boundless future in store for the young company. \u201cWe\u2019re totally changing the way that people interact with remote robots by giving that crucial sense of touch.\u201d\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aEvdQiRdMC0#t=21\">Learn more about BluHaptics<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>"},{"title":"Solving for success","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/solving-for-success\/","tags":["arts-sciences","graduate-school","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["public-good"],"image":"","excerpt":"Once a homeless youth with a devastating addiction to drugs and alcohol, Mark Bennett is on his way to earning his bachelor\u2019s in mathematics at the UW \u2014 all while giving back to the community that saved him and raising his 9-year-old son.","content":"(Homepage, February 2015)\n\nLike any other 13-year-old kid, Mark Bennett just wanted to fit in.\n\nImpressionable and aching for a sense of belonging, Mark turned to a group of teenage boys who hung out around his Fairwood, Washington neighborhood. \u201cThey wanted to be gangsters, and I wanted to be tough like them.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention says a whopping 1.6 million to 3.8 million sports-related concussions occur annually in the U.S., and those numbers are conservative \u2014 as many as 50 percent of concussions go unreported. For the UW helmet research team, stories like Zack\u2019s aren\u2019t just a serious public health issue facing today\u2019s society; they\u2019re the reason VICIS \u2014 which means \u201cchange\u201d in Latin \u2014 was formed: to turn UW research and innovation into impact.The UW has become the epicenter for concussion prevention advocacy, and the first law to protect youth sports concussion safety came out of Washington state in 2009 after 13-year-old Zackery Lystedt was put back on the field just 15 minutes after suffering a concussion. It was a devastating decision that ultimately landed Zack on life support and a years-long recovery process to relearn basic skills.\n\n\u201cHelmet technology hasn\u2019t evolved much at all in 40 or 50 years,\u201d says McMinn Endowed Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering <a href=\"https:\/\/www.me.washington.edu\/research\/faculty\/jposner\/index.html\">Jonathan Posner<\/a>, who works on the project alongside Professor and Department Chair of Mechanical Engineering <a href=\"https:\/\/www.me.washington.edu\/research\/faculty\/reinhall\/index.html\">Per Reinhall<\/a>. \u201cEngineering and medicine are working together to come up with a practical solution.\u201d\n\nThat solution is a much-needed update on the current helmet using the brains of faculty and students right here on campus, and if the support from the NFL, Under Armour and GE in the form of a $500,000 grant as a winner of the second annual <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nfl.com\/news\/story\/0ap1000000238256\/article\/nfl-under-armour-ge-launch-head-health-challenge-ii\">Head Health Challenge<\/a> is any indication, the team is on the right track.\n\nThe UW has the opportunity to earn an additional $1 million in research funding from the Head Health Challenge this year, but the bulk of the support continues to come from its own backyard. VICIS\u2019 offices are housed at CoMotion\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/comotion.uw.edu\/incubator\">New Ventures Facility<\/a>.

For football helmets, it\u2019s obvious: They need something to protect their heads. But there are other aspects, too. How you clean the helmet, service it, and take it off of someone\u2019s injured head. What it looks like. All of those aspects feed into how the helmet is designed and developed.\u201d\n<h2>Helping build\u00a0a better helmet<\/h2>\nAs far as football\u2019s concerned, Ryan Smith is more of an observer than a player.\n\n\u201cI found out I was one of those people who didn\u2019t quite like getting hit,\u201d the senior in mechanical engineering says with a laugh.\n\nFitting, considering his role is to conduct the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) drop test, which involves dropping a helmet-wearing humanoid head model onto an anvil from varying heights to rate the severity of the impact.

In those settings, he had to find creative ways to provide modern, minimally invasive treatments to soldiers with serious traumatic injury.\n\nA vascular surgeon by specialty, Ben envisioned a number of surgical inventions while on the battlefield. At Harborview Medical Center, he is putting his ideas to the test.\n\n\u201cIt is amazing to be in this world-class trauma center where we have the resources to conduct so many clinical trials to advance treatment methods,\u201d says Ben.\n\nSince coming to Harborview in 2007, Ben has led multiple research projects focused on blood vessel diseases and trauma. One procedure he pioneered can treat the bulging artery of an aneurysm without an open-chest operation. The technique involves the insertion of a personally fitted stent graft, or tube, into the patient\u2019s endangered artery. Its clinical trials have shown highly successful outcomes.\n\nFormer patient Matthew Endicott experienced this procedure firsthand. In 2013, Matthew had a potentially fatal tear in his aorta that qualified him for the trial. Ben\u2019s treatment spared Matthew the long-term complications that can result from traditional, higher-risk surgery. Today, Matthew is doing very well.\n\n\u201cI cannot say enough good things about Dr. Starnes and his team,\u201d says Matthew\u2019s mother Greta Sedlock. \u201cHe ensured Matthew and I understood what the clinical trial entailed, and he was so compassionate.\u201d\n\nTo show her appreciation, Greta created the Matthew Endicott Fund for Dr. Benjamin Starnes. Ben and his colleagues used the funding to support 13 vascular research projects, seven of which were accepted at a recent conference. Given the continued risks associated with standard surgical methods for vascular diseases, the need for such research remains strong.\n\n\u201cGifts like Greta\u2019s are so powerful,\u201d says Ben. \u201cThey allow us to build on our efforts to save more lives.\u201d"},{"title":"Giving thanks","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/giving-thanks\/","tags":["giving","medicine"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"The gifts that Greta Sedlock, '77, and her late husband Tom, '70, '74, made to the UW support innovators at the UW, including the surgeon who saved Greta's son's life.","content":"<p class=\"intro\">(Homepage, November 2014)<\/p>\nIn 2013, Greta Sedlock found herself in a hospital room at UW Medicine Harborview Medical Center with her son Matthew, who had a potentially fatal tear in his aorta. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.uwmedicine.org\/bios\/benjamin-starnes\">Dr. Ben Starnes<\/a>, chief of the Vascular Surgery Division, explained to them that Matthew\u2019s severe diagnosis qualified him for a clinical trial involving a surgical method that Ben pioneered.\n\u201cI was so grateful that Matthew qualified for that clinical trial, and I was so impressed by Dr. Starnes\u2019 compassion and expertise,\u201d says Greta.Matthew participated in the trial, which entailed a minimally invasive procedure that Ben performed using a personally fitted stent.

This passion led him to create in his will the Thomas Joseph Sedlock Icon Endowed Scholarships for UW students studying science, technology, engineering and math. Specifically, the scholarships go to students who are creative risk-takers following unconventional paths in their research.

With help from the UW\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/comotion.uw.edu\/\">CoMotion<\/a>, in 2015 they successfully spun-off their startup and licensed the vHAB technology. They\u2019ve also presented vHAB at the American Occupational Therapy Association\u2019s annual conference, and completed the Jones + Foster Accelerator, a program at the <a href=\"http:\/\/foster.uw.edu\/\">Foster School of Business<\/a> that helps student-led startups get off the ground.\n\nUp next? The group began initial market testing, with their first pilot customer providing feedback on vHAB.

Whether a tough \u201cboss\u201d is defeated or a racecourse is conquered, that sense of accomplishment pushes players to take on the next level of the game. To patients undergoing stroke and traumatic injury rehabilitation, this motivation, combined with the immersive aspect of virtual reality, could also serve as encouragement during a long and slow recovery process.\n\nSince January, UW students Tyler Libey, Brian Mogen and Dimitrios Gklezakos and Technology Commercialization fellow Lars Crawford have worked to make this idea a reality. The students are the team behind vHAB, or \u201cvirtual rehabilitation,\u201d a device featuring a series of video games that double as rehabilitative exercises.\n\nvHAB began as an entry in the Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering\u2019s (CSNE) 2014 Tech Sandbox Competition. Tyler and Brian, doctoral students in bioengineering, had joined forces with Lars, then an undergraduate studying neurobiology, to create a working neural engineering prototype. With experience in motion-sensing technology already under their belts, the team decided to put their skills to the test by fashioning a device that could help people with muscle disorders or injuries.\n\nAfter seeking guidance from Dr. Jared Olson, who specializes in rehabilitation medicine at Harborview Medical Center, Tyler and Brian shadowed physicians as they worked with stroke patients. Witnessing the struggles these patients experienced, the team was inspired to turn their technology into something that could help make the recovery process much easier.\n\nUsing an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset and a Leap Motion device \u2014 which detects and measures hand movements \u2014 the team developed a series of games emulating the therapy tasks they observed at Harborview. One game requires players to place ingredients on a pizza, while another has them brush a giant\u2019s teeth. As each level is completed, the tasks increase in difficulty, all while motivating patients by tracking how far they have come in improving muscle movement.\n\nSince taking first place in the Tech Sandbox Competition, the team has fervently worked to make their project a reality. With an eventual goal of having vHAB prescribed to patients, the team is focused on securing funding for their first patient study. The staff at the UW\u2019s Center for Commercialization (C4C) has been guiding them through the process of pitching to investors and marketing their product. Both during and after the Tech Sandbox, the C4C has provided substantial help and encouragement. \u201cEveryone we\u2019ve met through the C4C continues to be contacts, which has been really important,\u201d says Tyler. \u201cThey\u2019ve been able to see our trajectory, and I think it makes them excited because they were in on the ground floor of it.\u201d\n\nThe team has begun presenting vHAB to therapists, and the initial results were nothing short of encouraging. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen their eyes light up and they say, \u2018When can we have this? I can\u2019t wait for people to use this,\u2019\u201d says Brian proudly. \u201cWe actually have the opportunity to help a lot of people,\u201d adds Lars. \u201cThere are so many that could benefit from something like this.\u201d\n<h2>Engineering an intercollegiate partnership<\/h2>\nNot long after winning the Tech Sandbox, Brian and Tyler were chatting with a peer from San Diego State University (SDSU) about the competition. While SDSU and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are partner institutions of the CSNE, neither yet holds a similar event. \u201cThe Sandbox is an unparalleled opportunity,\u201d says Tyler, \u201cand we were thinking of how we could bring that to our counterparts.\u201d Hoping to provide the hands-on experience of the Sandbox, they organized a 48-hour hackathon, in which students from the UW, SDSU and MIT worked to create low-cost devices in the field of neuroscience.\n\nFrom acquiring the tools to build prototypes, to calculating the number of energy drinks to fuel participants, Brian and Tyler set up the students for success. And it worked. At the end of the weekend, they were amazed at the results. \u201cI was absolutely floored by the quality of projects that students put together in less than 30 hours,\u201d says Brian. Furthermore, students from SDSU and MIT began to promote the CSNE on their campuses. Ultimately, Tyler hopes that the event will build \u201ca legacy of tradition\u201d for the center and continue igniting students\u2019 passion for engineering.\n\n<a class=\"more\" href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/news\/blog\/neural-engineering-hackathon-36-hours-15-students-five-working-prototypes\/\">Read more about the hackathon<\/a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Explore the UW<\/h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.washington.edu\/news\/blog\/neural-engineering-hackathon-36-hours-15-students-five-working-prototypes\/\">Neural engineering hackathon: 36 hours, 15 students, five working prototypes<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/csne-erc.org\/\">Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/uwc4c\/\">Center of Commercialization<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<h3>What is the Tech Sandbox?<\/h3>\nThe CSNE\u2019s Tech Sandbox Competition provides a unique and unparalleled opportunity for UW students.

Efforts are underway to modify the Tech Sandbox for use at MIT, SDSU and other interested colleges and universities. More than fostering projects such as vHAB, the Tech Sandbox \u201ccan broaden people\u2019s ideas of what is possible,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe students are a force for innovation.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;"},{"title":"Arctic immersion","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/arctic-immersion\/","tags":["arts-sciences","global","graduate-student","undergraduate-student"],"pillars":["student-experience"],"image":"","excerpt":"Two\u00a0UW students traveled to the Arctic for intensive study of Inuktitut, the Inuit language, through a Canadian Studies<a style=\"font-style: inherit; color: #8e632a;\" href=\"http:\/\/jsis.washington.edu\/canada\/flas\/\">\u00a0Foreign Language Area and Studies (FLAS) Fellowship.<\/a>","content":"(College of Arts &amp; Sciences, October 2014)\n\nJason Young and Walter O\u2019Toole had been stranded on Arctic ice for nearly an hour, unable to find a safe path back to shore, when an Inuit woman observing from her kitchen dispatched her 13-year-old son to guide them to safety. It was one of many humbling moments for the UW students during a visit to the Canadian Arctic through a Canadian Studies<a href=\"http:\/\/jsis.washington.edu\/canada\/flas\/\"> Foreign Language Area and Studies (FLAS) Fellowship.<\/a>\n\n\u201cYeah, we totally got stuck,\u201d laughs O\u2019Toole. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a maze out there. In certain places there are chunks of ice with cracks in them or space between them. We didn\u2019t really know how to jump over cracks and which ones were safe to jump over. When the boy came out, he knew just what to do. It\u2019s pretty incredible how well they know the ice.\u201d\n\nYoung and O\u2019Toole had traveled to the Arctic for intensive study of Inuktitut, the Inuit language, which they had been studying in Seattle prior to the trip. Young, a PhD student in <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/geog\/\">geography<\/a>, is interested in how indigenous communities use technology to engage in environmental activism. He decided to focus on the Inuit community after taking a graduate seminar on Arctic issues, and felt that familiarity with the Inuktitut language would strengthen his research.\n\nO\u2019Toole, an undergraduate majoring in <a href=\"http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/engl\/cw\/\">creative writing<\/a>, happened upon Inuktitut in the UW course catalog. \u201cMy dad worked in the Arctic for many years and told me stories about his time up there, so I\u2019ve always had this fascination with the ice and Inuit culture,\u201d he says. \u201cEven though Inuktitut might not be the most practical language outside of the Arctic, it intrigued me.\u201d O\u2019Toole has since added an\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.jsis.washington.edu\/arctic\/minor\/\">Arctic studies minor<\/a>, through which he has taken courses on the Arctic Ocean, marine policy, and climate change. \u201cThrough the minor, I\u2019ve been able to do some policy analysis and research,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really expanded my skill set.\u201d\n\nInuktitut language classes at the UW have been held mostly online, with instructors Mick Mallon and Alexina Kublu teaching via Skype from their home on Vancouver Island.\u00a0 \u201cThere are no other programs in the U.S. that offer Inuktitut and there aren\u2019t many teachers of Inuktitut, so this has been an awesome opportunity,\u201d says Young, \u201ceven if the Skype connection is sometimes a little buggy.\u201d\n\nStill, nothing beats learning language through immersion. Through their FLAS fellowships, Young and O\u2019Toole were able to travel to Igloolik, an Inuit town in remote northern Canada, to study Inuktitut where it is actually spoken. \u201cIgloolik is definitely the Arctic,\u201d says Young. \u201cThe landscape is barren with no trees. At the beginning of our trip, the ocean was pretty much a solid sheet of ice. Toward the end, it started to break up a bit.\u201d\n\nThere were many opportunities to explore that ice, but first came daily language lessons lasting up to six hours. Kublu, born and raised in Igloolik, returned to lead the daily sessions in person. Dozens of her relatives shared other aspects of Inuit culture with the UW students. They welcomed them to Canada Day and Nunavut Day festivities\u2014the latter celebrating the establishment of Canada\u2019s newest territory, governed primarily by Inuit. The relatives also invited Young and O\u2019Toole on a camping trip.\n\nThe journey to the remote campsite was a highlight of their stay. The destination was an island reached by a large sled, or <em>qamutiik, <\/em>pulled by a snowmobile<em>. <\/em>To envision the <em>qamutiiik,<\/em> imagine a convertible car on gliders, minus a car\u2019s comfort. Passengers sit on top of supplies and hold on for dear life. Sometimes they must jump off to help turn the sled on rough ice. The trip to the island took about six hours, involving tricky navigation around melting ice. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a sleigh ride to grandma\u2019s house, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d quips O\u2019Toole. \u201cWe were exhausted. It was a workout.\u201d\n\nYoung and O\u2019Toole found that having an intimate experience with the Arctic landscape and Inuit culture led to a better understanding of the language. \u201cThe language really is a part of the land,\u201d says Young, who offers the treatment of pronouns an example. While English speakers use \u201cit\u201d to refer to an object like their phone, Inuktitut speakers alter the pronoun to indicate whether the phone is directly in front of them, up high in front of them, down low in front of them, or out of sight. \u201cAs an English speaker, we think, \u2018It\u2019s still my phone. Why do I have to use a different word for it each time?\u2019\u201d says Young. \u201cBut being out there it makes more sense. They are a hunting culture out on this flat land. They have to see really far ahead\u00a0 and communicate very precisely where a certain animal is, whether it is moving or not, whether it is up high or down low.\u201d\n\nBack on the UW campus, Young and O\u2019Toole are continuing their language studies (along with UW law student Caitlyn Evans, who was unable to make the trip to Igloolik). Young is planning his dissertation, which will explore Inuit use of social media and other Internet technologies for activism around Arctic-related political issues. O\u2019Toole, who graduates at the end of autumn quarter, hopes to eventually pursue a master\u2019s degree in English. \u201cI\u2019d like to look at Inuit literature and be able to do criticism on that, especially if I get to the point where I can read it sufficiently well,\u201d he says. \u201cThere needs to be more focus on works of art that the Inuit are producing.\u201d\n\nBoth students hope to get back to Igloolik sooner rather than later. They promise that next time they\u2019ll steer clear of melting ice."},{"title":"Sky-high solution","link":"http:\/\/cms.local\/blog\/story\/sky-high-solution\/","tags":["arts-sciences","engineering","comotion","foster-school-of-business"],"pillars":["impact"],"image":"","excerpt":"With sights set sky high on streamlining coating for the aerospace industry, UW startup PolyDrop developed an additive that\u2019s grabbed the attention of Boeing \u2014 and they\u2019re just getting started.","content":"(Homepage, December 2014)\n\nWhen Volha Hrechka, \u201913, left her home country of Belarus on an exchange program in 2004, she had no idea she\u2019d one day be revolutionizing the plastics industry. Today her startup <a href=\"http:\/\/www.polydrop.net\/\">PolyDrop<\/a> is responsible for creating an innovative additive that dissipates electrostatic charge on airplanes one drop at a time \u2014 and it all started in the halls of the UW.\n\nPolyDrop is the result of Volha\u2019s chemical engineering senior design capstone project, where she worked with four other students on an additive inspired by Boeing.\n\nThe Seattle-area aircraft manufacturer was looking to cut weight and reduce CO2 emissions in an effort to save money and better the environment, and the PolyDrop team knew achieving those goals while dissipating electrostatic charge would be a problem with the new 787 Dreamliner. If the electrostatic charge isn\u2019t dissipated, it could interfere with flight communications, or worse, cause a spark that could potentially lead to fire.\n\nThe solution? An energy-conductive polymer additive that can be dropped into original coatings such as paint and adds only .25 percent additional weight \u2014 a drastic change from the current solution. And less weight means less fuel, which isn\u2019t only expensive, but harmful to the environment.\n\nBoeing will be testing PolyDrop\u2019s innovation in a variety of climates and if everything goes well, the aerospace giant could be ordering PolyDrop-infused paint from manufacturers in one to two years. In the meantime, the PolyDrop team, which is comprised of Volha, co-founder Greg Newbloom, and a handful of lab technicians, interns, advisors and business aids, is reaching for lower-hanging fruit \u2014 low volume but high performance applications, such as capacitors.\n\nNone of this would have been possible without the help of the UW, says Volha. \u201cCountless times I\u2019ve asked for help and it was always provided to me.
